  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>texture 8059.slc_esa 2 texture2 0 750 5 25 2 10
  0</samp></p>

  <p>Calculates the image texture (normalized second moment) of a
  complex valued input SAR image (in scomplex format = pairs of
  short integer). The estimation window size is 3 range x 15
  azimuth looks. The texture image is written out using a 2 range x
  10 azimuth looks multilooking.</p>

  <p><samp>texture 8059.slc_esa 2 texture2 1 750 5 25 2 10
  0</samp></p>

  <p>Calculates the image texture (defined as log) of a complex
  valued input SAR image (in scomplex format = pairs of short
  integer). The estimation window size is 3 range x 15 azimuth
  looks. The texture image is written out using a 2 range x 10
  azimuth looks multilooking</p>

  <p><samp>texture 8059.mli 0 texture0 750 0 5 5 1 1 0</samp></p>

  <p>Calculates the image texture (normalized second moment) based
  on the input real valued multilook SAR image. The estimation
  window size is 5 range x 5 azimuth samples of the multilook input
  image. The texture image is written out at the same sample
  spacing of the input image.</p>

  <p><samp>texture 8059.mli 0 texture0 750 0 5 5 1 1 0
  8059.mli_frost</samp></p>

  <p>Calculates the image texture (normalized second moment) based
  on the input real valued multilook SAR image. The estimation
  window size is 5 range x 5 azimuth samples of the multilook input
  image. The texture image is written out at the same sample
  spacing of the input image.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  texture estimates the texture of the input image. The image
  texture defined as the normalized second moment. Two texture
  definitions are included with the program. The first image
  texture type is calculated as the ratio between the standard
  deviation and the mean value of the values of the estimation
  window:</p>

  <p><code>type=0: texture = stdev / mean</code></p>

  <p><code>type=1: texture = log(average(I)) -
  average(log(i))</code></p>

  <p>The same user defined estimation window sizes and weighting
  functions are used for the estimation of the mean value and the
  standard deviation.</p>

  <p>If local mean values are provided in a seperate input file
  then the first moment is not calculated but read from this input
  file. This allows to previously determine the mean value using
  more advanced techniques, for example the MMSE technique with an
  adaptive estimator window size, or multi-temporal filtering. In
  the second approach the local mean value does not need to be
  constant over the estimator window used in the texture
  estimation. This has important advantages for the texture
  estimation. The estimator locally normalizes the input data
  values x_in using the local mean x_mean values:</p>

  <p><code>x_norm = (x_in/x_mean) - 1</code></p>

  <p>followed by the calculation of the second moment for the
  x_norm values.</p>

  <p>Different weighting functions can be selected. For
  weights_flag=0 a constant weighting function is applied, i.e. all
  filter coefficients are set to 1. For weights_flag=1 a linear
  weighting function is applied, i.e. the filter coefficients
  decrease linearly with increasing distance to the center of the
  filter window. For weights_flag=2 a Gaussian weighting function
  is applied, i.e. the filter coefficients decrease with
  inclreasing distance to the center of the filter window following
  a Gauss function.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  Userdefined filter window size and weighting function.</p>
