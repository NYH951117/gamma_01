  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em> supports running an S1 IWS co-registration
  and differential interferogram generation procedure that includes
  an iterative co-registration refinement estimated using intensity
  matching followed by an iterative co-registration refinement
  estimated using the spectral diversity method for the burst
  overlap areas as supported by <a href=
  "S1_poly_overlap.html">S1_poly_overlap</a>.</p>

  <p>The main steps of the of S1 TOPS SLC co-registration procedure
  correspond to the procedure described in Section 6.1 of the
  <a href="Sentinel-1_users_guide.pdf">Sentinel-1 Users Guide</a>,
  including the calculation of a co-registration lookup table based
  on the orbit geometry and terrain height and refinements of this
  lookup table using the intensity matching and the spectral
  diversity methods. The script <em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em> automates
  the entire procedure up the the differential interferogram. In
  this it iterates the matching refinement until the azimuth
  correction determined is below a defined threshold (0.01 SLC
  pixel). After reaching this quality it iterates the spectral
  diversity method until the azimuth correction determined is below
  another defined threshold (0.005 SLC pixel).</p>

  <p>As one important output an ASCII file containing quality
  information is generated. The name of this quality file is
  automatically generated from the reference and slave scene IDs
  using the style "ID1_ID2.coreg_quality". This file provides
  detailed information on the (iterative) co-registration
  refinements done, first using intensity matching and then using
  the spectral diversity method. For the intensity matching
  statistics of the matching are indicated. For the spectral
  diversity method information on the coherence and phase
  statistics are provided for each bursdt overlap area considered.
  Furthermore, the weighting factors used in the calculation of the
  global phase offset are indicated.</p>

  <p>In such a co-registration process the slave IWS SLC is
  resampled several times to the master geometry. This resampling
  can be significantly accelerated if it is done only for a small
  section of the entire scene. To limit the area (resampled and)
  used for the intensity matching refinement iterations a polygon
  area (20150308.mask.poly1) can be indicated. In the case the LAT
  programs are available only the data of this area is then
  resampled for the intensity matching refinement iterations.
  Similarly, the program <a href=
  "S1_poly_overlap.html">S1_poly_overlap</a> is used (within
  <em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em>) to only resample the burst overlap areas
  when doing the co-registration refinement iterations using the
  spectral diversity method.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, a second polygon area (20150308.mask.poly2) can
  be indicated to restrict the use of the spectral diversity method
  to suited areas. Here the focus is not on the accelaration of the
  resampling, but on avoiding low coherence and instable (moving)
  areas. The second polygon area can be used to exclude incoherence
  areas (e.g. ocean) as well as areas with significant movement in
  azimuth direction (e.g. glaciers) from the spectral diversity
  method. This is recommended as for areas with significant
  movement in azimuth direction phase offsets not related to the
  co-registration are expected.</p>

  <p>Polygon areas can be defined using the LAT program
  <em>polyras</em>. Without LAT programs <em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em>
  ignores the indicated polygons and does the resampling for the
  entire area. While this ensures that the program still runs users
  without access to the LAT module cannot benefit from the related
  significant computational efficiency gain possible.</p>

  <p>Once the final co-registration function (consisting of the
  lookup table that was updated with the intensity matching
  refinements, and the azimuth offset in the ISP offset parameter
  file "ID1_ID2.off" determined by iteratively using the spectral
  diversity method) the slave burst SLC is resampled to the
  reference burst SLC geometry. Furthermore, the mosaic SLC is
  calculated as well as the differential interferogram. To
  calculate the differential interferogram <a href=
  "phase_sim_orb.html">phase_sim_orb</a> is used to calculate the
  topopgraphic phase and <a href=
  "SLC_diff_intf.html">SLC_diff_intf</a> to calculate the
  multi-look differntial interferogram.</p>

  <p>The main reason that the differential interferogram
  ("ID1_ID2.diff") is calculated is that it should always be
  carefully checked by an operator for phase jumps at the burst
  interfaces. Such phase jumps are a clear indication for either a
  remaining co-registration error in the azimuth direction, or the
  presence of along-track motion that causes the phase jump, or the
  presence of ionospheric effects (along-track gradients in the
  ionospheric free electron concentration) that can also cause
  positional offsets in the azimuth direction which may then cause
  phase jumps.</p>

  <p>As input a pair (master and slave) of two Sentinel-1 (S1)
  Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) burst SLCs in their original
  geometry are provided. These burst SLCs consist of the sub-swath
  burst SLCs for one or several sub-swaths as defined in the
  SLC_tabs provided for the reference (e.g. 20141003.SLC_tab) and
  the slave (20141015.SLC_tab). For each sub-swath the SLC_tab
  contains one line with the burst SLC name (e.g 20141015.IW1.slc),
  the name of the SLC parameter file of the burst SLC (e.g
  20141015.IW1.slc.par), and the related TOPS parameter file (e.g.
  20141015.IW1.slc.TOPS_par). In this IW1 is used to indicate that
  it is for the first sub-swath (IW1).</p>

  <p>The indicated ID parameters (e.g. 20141003 and 20141015) are
  used in the naming of the intermediate files automatically
  generated by the program.</p>

  <p>Then an SLC_tab for the output slave scene that was resampled
  to the geometry of the reference burst SLC needs to be indicated.
  For an input slave SLC_tab 20141015.SLC_tab a possible output
  SLC_tab could be 20141015.RSLC_tab. For each sub-swath this
  output SLC_tab contains one line with the burst SLC name (e.g
  20141015.IW1.rslc), the name of the SLC parameter file of the
  burst SLC (e.g 20141015.IW1.rslc.par), and the related TOPS
  parameter file (e.g. 20141015.IW1.rslc.TOPS_par). These are all
  new filename of not yet existing files to be used as names for
  the generated resampled (co-registered) data sets. The output
  SLC_tab can be created using manual editing or using commands
  as<br>
  <i>echo "20141015.IW1.rslc 20141015.IW1.rslc.par
  20141015.IW1.rslc.TOPS_par" &gt; 20141015.RSLC_tab</i><br>
  <i>echo "20141015.IW2.rslc 20141015.IW2.rslc.par
  20141015.IW2.rslc.TOPS_par" &gt;&gt; 20141015.RSLC_tab</i><br>
  <i>echo "20141015.IW3.rslc 20141015.IW3.rslc.par
  20141015.IW3.rslc.TOPS_par" &gt;&gt; 20141015.RSLC_tab</i><br>
  .</p>

  <p>The height map indicated has to be in the same slant range
  geometry as the MLI mosaic image of the reference scene
  (generated using the same number of range and azimuth looks as
  indicated on the command line. Instead of indicating an existing
  height file it is possible to indicate a constant height value
  (e.g. 0.1 meter) to be used as a constant height reference. As a
  consequence the initial transormation lookup table calculated
  based on the orbit geometry and the DEM will be of slightly lower
  quality. The level of degradation of the quality also depends
  significantly on the perpendicular baseline between the master
  and slave scenes. For longer baselines (&gt; 100m) and in high
  mountainous areas using DEM heigth is strongly recommended.</p>

  <p>To apply the refined azimuth offset refinement you need to
  rerun the slave burst SLC resampling, but using the output offset
  parameter file instead of the input offset parameter file (when
  running the the program SLC_interp_S1_TOPS).</p>

  <p>In the second part of the iterative co-registration
  refinement</p>

  <p><em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em> runs the program <a href=
  "S1_coreg_overlap.html">S1_coreg_overlap</a> to apply a spectral
  diversity method to all the available burst overlap regions of
  all the available sub-swaths (expect those areas masked by the
  indicated polygon poly2). On the command line of
  <em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em> it is possible to indicate relevant
  parameters used by <a href=
  "S1_coreg_overlap.html">S1_coreg_overlap</a> such as the
  coherence threshold used, the minimum valid fraction of unwrapped
  phase values used, and the phase standard deviation threshold
  used.</p>

  <p>The determined azimuth offset correction from <a href=
  "S1_coreg_overlap.html">S1_coreg_overlap</a> is used to update
  the constant value of the azimuth offset polynomial in the offset
  parameter file.</p>

  <p><em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em> generates a large amount of
  intermediate files, including interferograms, coherence maps,
  coherence masks, unwrapped phases, etc. for every available burst
  overlap regions. Normally, these many intermediate files are
  directly deleted at the end of the program without looking at it
  in detail. In cases where the co-registration refinement result
  does not converge or where the quality number give indications of
  problems it is recommended not to deleted the intermediate files
  and check them carefully to be able to optimize the tresholds
  used. Deleting or not deleting the intermediate files is done by
  setting the cleaning flag to 1 (which is the default and which
  means the files are deleted) or to 0 to keep the intermediate
  files.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br></p>

  <p>Using <em>S1_coreg_TOPS</em> to do the co-registration for a
  slave acquired with a long temporal separation from the master
  scene may result in generally reduced coherence. As a way to
  optimize the coherence it is possible to indicate in addition to
  the master burst SLC a second already co-registered SLC (possibly
  one close in time to the slave considered). The program uses then
  this second scene to calculate the double-difference
  interferograms, while the master geometry is the one of the true
  master.</p>

  <p>There is the possibility to set the flag1 parameter to 1 to
  use already existing files (e.g. the MLI mosaic of the reference
  scene or the looklup table calculated using rdc_trans. This
  option may be suited to gain time when testing..</p>
