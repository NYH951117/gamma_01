  <p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>

  <p><samp>SR_to_GRD 8560.mli.par - 8560.grd.par 8560.mli
  8560.mli_grd 1 1 1 20.0 20.0</samp></p>

  <p>Converts the multi-look intensity image 8560.mli from
  slant-range to ground-range with a 20m pixel spacing in ground
  range and azimuth (using spline interpolation).</p>

  <p><samp>SR_to_GRD 8560.slc.par - 8560.grd.par 8560.mli
  8560.mli_grd 3 3 2 50.0</samp></p>

  <p>Converts the multi-look intensity image 8560.mli from
  slant-range to ground-range with a 50m pixel spacing in ground
  range and azimuth. Prior to the geometric transformation a 3 x 3
  multi-looking is performed to reduce the spatial resolution of
  the input image to a resolution similar to that of the output
  ground-range image. Logarithmic spline interpolation is used.</p>

  <p><samp>SR_to_GRD 8560.slc.par 8560_8059.off 8560_8059.grd.par
  8560_8059.cc 8560_8059.cc_grd 1 1 1 20.0</samp></p>

  <p>Converts the real valued coherence image 8560_8059.cc from
  slant-range to ground-range with a 20m pixel spacing in range and
  azimuth. The input geometry is defined by 8560.slc.par and
  8560_8059.off.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  This program transforms real valued images from slant-range to
  ground-range geometry. The input and output image data are of
  type float. Typical examples to be converted are backscatter
  intensity images (as generated by multi-looking and detection of
  an SLC or in the interferometric processing) and coherence
  images. The input image geometry is specified by the SLC
  parameter file (*.slc.par) and the ISP/offset parameter file
  (*.off). For a multi-look intensity image generated with the
  program <a href="multi_look.html">multi_look</a>, only the SLC
  parameter file of the MLI image (*.mli.par) is required. In this
  case - is indicated on the command line instead of the ISP/offset
  parameter file name. The output geometry is specified in the GRD
  parameter file (*.grd.par). The format of the SLC parameter file
  of the ground range (GRD) image which has the same format as the
  SLC parameter files of SLC and MLI slant range images.</p>

  <p>In the case that the indicated SLC parameter file of the
  ground range image (*.grd.par) is not existing a new output SLC
  parameter file (*.grd.par) is created. The selected output image
  near range ground range value corresponds to the near range slant
  range position of the input image. Either the indicated output
  ground range and azimuth pixel spacings are used, or if nothing
  is indicated the output pixel spacings are calculated as the
  input image azimuth pixel spacing multiplied with the indicated
  azimuth multi-looking factor. The output image starting time
  corresponds to the input image starting time. Offsets indicated
  in the *.off file are accounted for. The ouput image geometric
  parameters are determined such that the ouput image covers the
  entire input image.</p>

  <p>In the case an already existing GRD parameter file (*.grd.par)
  is provided no new GRD parameter file (*.grd.par) is created.
  Near range ground range, image starting time, ground range and
  azimuth pixel spacing, number of ground range samples and number
  of azimuth lines indicated in the provided GRD parameter file are
  used (without consideration of sample spacing values indicated on
  the command line). This concept allows to transform only the
  sub-section of the input image which corresponds to the output
  ground range geometry defined in the GRD parameter file. To
  define such a sub-section the output parameter file needs to be
  edited. You may, for example first transform the entire image to
  ground range. Then edit the GRD parameter file to select a
  subsection and then transform only the data for the selcted
  sub-section.</p>

  <p>In the case the SLC parameter file of the output ground range
  image contains slant range polynomial coefficients (as provided
  for ENVISAT ASAR ground range images) this polynomial is used for
  the transformation, otherwise the slant range to ground range
  conversion is calculated asuming a local spherical earth
  model.</p>

  <p>The number of looks selected in range and azimuth should
  roughly correspond to the desired image spacing to achieve the
  best radiometric and geometric fidelity. For an ERS 5-look image
  for example the projected resolution is around 20m x 20m. When
  resampled to a ground-range image with 20m or 25m pixel spacing
  multi-looking factors 1 in azimuth and range are appropriate.
  When resampling the same image to a ground-range image with 100m
  multi-looking factors 5 in azimuth and range is preferred. This
  multi-looking is done prior to the geometric tranformation.</p>

  <p>If the output image spacing is not specified, then the output
  image azimuth and ground-range pixel spacing are determined by
  multiplying the input image azimuth spacing by the number of
  azimuth looks. The ground range is determined by making a best
  spherical fit to the earth curvature across track, perpendicular
  to the heading. The distance from the satellite ground track to
  the start of the image swath in ground range is stored in the
  range to start of GRD parameter file *.grd.par file. For
  nearest-neighbor resampling, two dimensional quadratic spline
  interpolation, and two-dimensional quadratic spline interpolation
  the interpretation of the image in terms of logarithmic scale dB
  values may be selected as an option to prevent generation of
  negative values in the output image. The real valued input and
  output image data may be displayed using <a href=
  "ISP_display.html">dispwr</a>, Notice that the image width
  changed during the transformation. Alternately, the intensity
  image can be scaled and stored as a SUN raster or BMP format
  image using <a href="ISP_display.html">raspwr</a>.</p>
