  <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
  <i>adf</i> reads the complex valued interferogram, computes
  locally the interferogram power spectrum, designs a filter based
  on the power spectrum, filters the interferogram , estimates the
  phase noise coherence value for the filtered interferogram and
  writes out the filtered interferogram and coherence map.&nbsp;
  The algorithm is based upon the paper by Goldstein and Werner
  (<i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>, vol. 25, no. 21. pp.
  4035-4038, 1998).</p>

  <p>The goal of the adaptive filtering step is to reduce phase
  noise thereby reducing the number of residues.A residue is a
  point in the&nbsp; interferogram where the sum of the phase
  differences between pixels around a closed path is not 0.0. The
  phase differences in the wrapped interferogram lie between -PI
  and +PI . Phase unwrapping determines the number of multiples of
  2PI to add to every point in the interferogram based on some
  minimization criterium. Residues exist as pairs. Generally,
  thermal noise causes pairs of residues that are close together to
  be generated. Filtering of the interferogram reduces the noise
  and hence the total number of residues.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the user must be aware that too strong
  filtering may introduce phase unwrapping errors by eliminating
  fringes. The filter significantly reduces the phase noise for
  areas with sufficiently reliable phase information. while high
  phase noise areas are minimally affected. The exponent for
  non-linear filtering determines the filter strength with larger
  values leading to greater filtering. Filtering is implemented
  using the FFT, which is nominally restricted to a power of 2,
  though use of the FFTW subroutine library, loosens this
  restriction, such that the FFT size for this application should
  be even.&nbsp; For the filtering of rapidly changing phase
  aassociated with the&nbsp; topographic phase of rugged terrain a
  small FFT size (16,32) is better.&nbsp; Larger FFT window sizes
  are preferred in regions of low fringe visibility but this only
  when the phase slope can be assumed constant over the estimation
  window. In the case rather flat terrain and for terrain phase
  removed differential interferograms larger window sizes as 32
  --&gt;246 lead to good results. Multiple application of the
  filter is possible, and can lead to better results when using
  large values of the filter exponent parameter.</p>

  <p>The argument of the complex valued output filtered
  interferogram corresponds to the filtered phase, the magnitude to
  a "phase noise coherence estimate" of the output image. This
  "phase noise coherence estimate" is a measure for the phase noise
  of the filtered interferogram and can be used in the phase
  unwrapping to mask low coherence areas. To facilitate this it is
  possible to write the "phase noise coherence estimate" out to a
  seperate file.</p>

  <p>The processing step parameter influences the processing time.
  Small values lead to a slightly smoother filtered output image
  and longer processing times. The dimensions of the smoothed
  interferogram file are identical to that of the interferogram
  file. Therefore, the programs to generate SUN raster or BMP
  format images and screen display may use the same parameters.</p>

  <p>An important parameter is the fraction of points that are
  non-zero within the filter window,&nbsp;<i><font color=
  "#000000">wfrac_min</font></i><font color="#FF0000">.</font> This
  threshold prevents filtering of regions with few valid data
  values such at image edges. Setting the value to .25 gives
  filtered output at every input pixel with non-zero input
  value</p>
