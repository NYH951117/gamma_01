  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>fspf_pt pt pmask1 08256.rslc.par pdiff0 pdiff0.spf 14 0 500
  2 1</samp></p>Conducts a fast spatial filtering of record 14 of
  the point data stack pdiff0 (fcomplex). Points within a radius of
  500 SLC range samples are taken into account for the the spatial
  filtering of each point. The data type of the input and output
  data set is fcomplex. The spatial filter type chosen is a
  quadratic weighted average (1 - (r/r_max)**2). After the
  filtering operation the solution is expanded to the entire point
  list.<samp>fspf_pt pt pmask1 08256.rslc.par punw1 punw1.spf - 2
  500 2</samp>

  <p>Same as above except that (1) the filtering is performed for
  all data records of the point stack and that (2) the solution is
  not expanded to the entire point list and that (3) data type is
  float.</p>

  <p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong><br>
  Source code fspf_pt.c in ./IPTA/src, executable version fspf_pt
  in ./IPTA/bin</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  In the estimation of orbital phase trends and long-wavelength
  atmospheric path delays spatial filtering with large filter
  windows is frequently applied in an IPTA processing. Using spf_pt
  such filtering is supported, but in the case of very large
  windows it is very slow. The main objective of the program
  fspf_pt is to provide a useful alternative for such filtering
  which is computationally much more efficient. fspf_pt can be used
  for both complex valued point interferograms (e.g. pdiff obtained
  after subtracting of the simulated topographic phase, or
  re-wrapped residual phases from a regression analysis) or float
  data (residual phases, atmospheric path delays).<br></p>

  <p>fspf_pt supports a fast spatial filtering of point data
  stacks. Either one or all records can be filtered. The points to
  be considered in the filtering can be indicated through the
  spatial radius (indicated in range samples).<br></p>

  <p>The functionality of fspf_pt is essentially similar (except
  reference point bias removal) to <a href=
  "spf_pt.html">spf_pt</a>, however, the spatial filtering is
  performed for large filter windows within a much shorter program
  execution time. The speedup is obtained via a two-step approach
  consisting of an unweighted multilooking and a weighted spatial
  filtering of the multilooked data.<br></p>

  <p>Using fspf_pt with small window sizes is not recommended (use
  <a href="spf_pt.html">spf_pt</a> instead).<br></p>

  <p>If a point mask is indicated only the values listed in the
  mask as valid points are considered in the filtering.
  Nevertheless, filtered (interpolated) values can be written out
  to all other points, as well, if the output mask flag is set to
  1.<br></p>

  <p>Either one record or all records can be filtered. To select
  all records in the stack enter "-" for the record number.
  Different format types (0:fcomplex 1:scomplex 2:float, default -:
  float) are supported. The format of the output point data stack
  with the filtered values has the same type as the input point
  data stack.<br></p>

  <p>The SLC parameter file associated with the point list
  coordinate geometry is required to calculate ground distances
  between pairs of points. Such distances are calculated using the
  ground range sampling (calculated from slant range sampling and
  incidence angle) and the azimuth spacing. The maximum search area
  radius is indicated in SLC range samples. Only valid points, i.e.
  points with a non-zero value in the mask are considered. For
  points with a zero in the mask the output is set to the NULL
  value, unless the output mask flag is set to 1.<br></p>

  <p>For the spatial filtering constant weights, a linearly
  decreasing ramp (linear with ground distance), a quadratic, or a
  Gaussian distance-weighed average can be selected. Points with
  NULL values in the input data are not considered in the
  filtering. For float data values, filtering based upon a
  least-squares planar fit to the data values is the default
  filtering method (spf_type = 4). This gives a better estimate of
  the filtered data when the data points are not uniformly
  distributed over the search region, e.g. at the edges of
  data.<br></p>
