  Same as above, but there are no files filtered, other than the
  reference image itself.&nbsp; The output files are optional.<br>

  <h3>Description</h3><span style=
  "font-style: italic;">mt_lee_filt</span> is based on an algorithm
  for speckle reduction described in [1] by J.S. Lee et al. This
  adaptive filter uses a set of 8 edge aligned window functions to
  select the homogeneous area associated with a particular pixel.
  The algorithm determines the window that best describes the
  region that a particular pixel belongs to. The deviation of
  center pixel relative to the average value over the selected
  window is used to determine a filter weighting factor that blends
  the local signal value with the average calculated using the
  window function. If the current pixel deviates strongly from the
  average of any edge aligned window function, very little or no
  filtering is applied. The algorithm determines both the best edge
  aligned filter and the weighting function. There are 8 edge
  aligned filters in 4 groups that are tested. The size of the
  window is either 7x7, 13x13 or 19x19 samples and the window
  functions are:<br>

  <ol>
    <li>top half, bottom half</li>

    <li>left side, right-side</li>

    <li>upper right triangle, lower left triangle</li>

    <li>upper left triangle, lower right triangle</li>
  </ol>The window function is either 1 or 0. Those samples where
  the window function is 1, are averaged in the window, while those
  set to 0 are ignored. The filter output is a linear combination
  of the local value at position x,y in the reference image and the
  average over the filter window. The filter has the advantage that
  it is effective in preserving rapid variations in backscatter,
  yet strongly filtering speckle noise in homogeneous regions. The
  user can write out the filtered reference scene, the weighting
  coefficient beta, the index of the selected filter window, and
  the mean to sigma ratio as 32-bit float computers.<br>
  <br>
  The user can set a threshold for accepting the directional
  filtering operation based on a contrast threshold. The better the
  fit of the data to directional filter, the higher the
  contrast.<br>
  For regions with directional contrast exceeding the threshold,
  the directional filtering is applied, otherwise pixels from the
  entire region are considered. The value of the contrast varies
  between 0 and 4.0. If cthres is set to 0.0, then the directional
  filter is always applied. If the value is cthres is set to 4.0,
  then there will be no directional filtering.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  An feature of <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">mt_lee_filt</span> is that the filter
  weight and index of the selected filter window are used to filter
  other scenes. Typically the reference scene used to compute the
  weighting coefficient and filter window is a multi-look sum and
  is very reliable. The other scenes are stored in a list. If there
  is a list of input data files, then there must be a list of the
  output file names provided by the user. The filter coefficients
  and the edge aligned filter number are then used to filter the
  entire stack of scenes.&nbsp; The user&nbsp; has the option to
  save the weighting factor, edge-aligned filter number, and the
  mean/sigma ratio.<br>
  <br>
  An example of a the filter in action, we use a multi-look image
  of the Lost-Hills oil field in California. The scene pixel sample
  spacing is about 15 meters in range and azimuth. The reference
  image is an average of 24 scenes, with each of the 24 scenes
  containing 5 look pixels. However the images have relatively high
  interferometric correlation. In this example the effective number
  of looks parameter L is set to 48 and the window size to 7.&nbsp;
  In the case of a homogeneous region, the number of samples in the
  spatial average generated by this filter is approximately 24. The
  original and filtered images are shown below. Note that the
  filter preserves resolution while filtering homogeneous
  regions.<br>
