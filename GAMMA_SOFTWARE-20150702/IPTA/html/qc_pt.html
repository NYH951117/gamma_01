  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>qc_pt&nbsp;plist pmask_in pmask_out
  SLC_par&nbsp;itab&nbsp;pbase 0&nbsp;pdiff 1 1.1</samp></p>

  <p>For the point list (plist) the quality of each point is
  evaluated based on the phase standard deviation of the
  differential interferometric phase (pdiff) from the selected 2-D
  regression model of pairs of nearby points. Good/bad points, i.e.
  points with a phase standard deviation smaller/larger than the
  indicated threshold, are accepted/rejected by setting the
  corresponding mask values in&nbsp;pmask_out to 1/0. &nbsp;Only
  points that are not masked out in pmask_in (set to 0) are
  considered for quality evaluation. If pmask_in is set to -, then
  all points in plist are evaluated.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  In the IPTA point lists contain the coordinates (range and
  azimuth pixel number relative to the reference SLC geometry) of
  the selected points. Data at these points (SLC values,
  interferogram values, ...) are stored in point data stacks with
  each record corresponding to a different SLC or interferogram.
  The point data stack of mask values contains for each point a
  flag (0 or 1) which indicates if the data of a point are
  considered (1) or not considered (0).</p>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">qc_pt</span> supports the
  validation of the quality of the points of an existing point
  list. The main input used for this step includes an existing
  point list and the related point data stack of differential
  interferograms. This input list shall include a significant
  fraction of good points as well as other points. <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">qc_pt</span> determines the validity of
  these candidate points using the phase standard deviation of a
  regression model as the quality criteria. The robustness and
  efficiency of the quality assessment is lower than the one of
  <span style="font-style: italic;">expand_pt</span>, but no list
  of validated point is required.</p>

  <p>The candidate point list is defined through the point list,
  plist, the point data stack of mask values, pmask, the stack of
  SLC parameters, pSLC_par, the interferogram table, itab, and the
  stack of interferogram baselines, pbase. The corresponding
  differential interferogram values are in the point data stack
  pdiff.&nbsp; If the differential interferometric data are in
  fcomplex form the phase of the data in the pdiff&nbsp; must be
  unwrapped. An initial search of the possible parameter values is
  performed to unwrap the data. These parameters include the
  differential height, deformation rate, and phase
  constant.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The command line parameters def_max and dh_max determine the
  range of values for the initial search. The search range for the
  differential height between the reference point and the test
  point is +/- def_max meters.&nbsp; Similarly, the range of
  deformation rates is +/- def_max meters/year. The processing time
  of the program strongly depends on the range of values used for
  the test.&nbsp; If the terrain is known to be relatively flat,
  then dh_max can be reduced. Similarly, if the expected
  deformation rate between the reference point and the test point
  is expected to exceed 5mm/year, then the value of def_max can be
  increased.&nbsp; For the program qc_pt the reference point is
  chosen to be as close as possible to the&nbsp; test points and
  the values of the&nbsp; parameters can be adjusted. to speed up
  processing&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">qc_pt</span> goes through
  the candidate point list and determines for each point a quality
  measure based on a phase regression analysis (using a one or two
  dimensional regression model) for pairs of nearby points. While a
  high quality indicates that both points are of "good points" a
  low quality indicates that one or the other or both points are
  "bad points". Therefore, for a specific point all possible
  partner points up to a certain distance (radius) are checked
  until a high quality is found for a specific pair. The quality of
  the points can be optionally written to the file specified by the
  psigma parameter.</p>

  <p>The regression analysis can be restricted to shorter baselines
  and/or shorter time intervals only. The baseline considered is
  the absolute value of the perpendicular component. The time
  interval considered is the absolute value of the acquisition time
  difference between the reference and slave SLC. The search radius
  can be indicated on the command line in number of pixels. For
  areas with a low points density it is important that the search
  area is big enough to include a sufficient number of other
  points.</p>

  <p>Chances to identify "good" points increase if the differential
  interferogram is of high quality, which is assured by subtracting
  a high quality simulated phase. Topographic, deformation, and
  atmospheric phase terms should be modeled as good as possible,
  which means the most accurate terrain height estimates,
  baselines, deformation models, and atmospheric phase terms should
  be used. On the other hand the chances are also increased by
  using very local reference, as correction terms (height
  corrections, relative deformation, relative atmospheric
  difference) remain small over short distances. Furthermore, not
  just one, but all possible references within an indicated radius
  are tested. This, and the factor that no pre-existing list of
  validated points is used make <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">qc_pt</span> the tool for the generation of
  an initial validated point list which can then later on be
  expanded using expand_pt.</p>

  <p>The point data stacks of differential interferograms can be
  provided in fcomplex or float (unwrapped phases) format.</p>

  <p>Initial or precision baseline estimates can be used.</p>

  <p>As phase regression models there are several options:<br>
  1. 1-d model depending on height differentials alone<br>
  2. 1-d model depending on deformation rate alone<br>
  3. 2-d model depending on both height differentials and
  deformation rate<br>
  Each of these three models can include an optional phase constant
  parameter. The phase constant is required if a single SLC used as
  the reference for all interferograms. If there are different SLCs
  are used as the reference for the for the interferograms in the
  stack the phase constant is 0.0 and does not need to be
  estimated. Use of the one-dimensional regression models
  constrains the regression and gives better results for small
  stacks or early on in the analysis when large height corrections
  are expected.</p>

  <p>Programs to generate new point lists (e.g. the candidate point
  list) are <span style="font-style: italic;">image2pt, mkgrid,
  merge_pt, prox_pt, pwr_stat</span>, and <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">sp_stat</span>.</p>

  <p>Programs to validate existing point lists are <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">qc_pt</span> and <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">expand_pt</span>. The funcitionality of
  <span style="font-style: italic;">qc_pt</span> is similar to the
  one of <span style="font-style: italic;">expand_pt</span> in the
  sense that a mask is generated for a candidate list based on a
  quality measure. <span style="font-style: italic;">qc_pt</span>
  differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">expand_pt</span>
  in that it does not require a validated list of good points which
  permits a wider application but at a significantly lower
  efficiency.</p>
