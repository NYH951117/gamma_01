  <p>Adaptive coherence estimation with consideration of local
  interferogram phase slope and local backscatter image texture.
  The adaptive estimation window size is between 2.0 and 9.0, using
  a gaussian weighting function.</p>

  <p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong><br>
  Source code cc_ad.c in ./src. For compilation adjust and use
  Makefile: Executable version cc_ad in ../bin</p>

  <p><strong>AVAILABILITY</strong><br>
  Uses ISP type definition file <a href=
  "typedef_ISP.h.html">typedef_ISP.h</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  cc_ad reads the complex normalized interferogram and the two
  corresponding backscatter intensity images and estimates for each
  pixel the degree of coherence.</p>

  <p>The estimator is adaptive in the sesnse that the estimator
  window size is adjusted adaptively to the local degree of
  coherence as estimated in an initial non-adaptive coherence
  estimation with a fixed estimator window size.</p>

  <p>To use an adaptive coherence estimator is motivated by the
  trade-off between spatial resolution of the coherence estimation
  and estimation bias. Large estimator windows result in lower bias
  but reduce the spatial resolution of the coherence estimate.
  Small estimator windows maintain a high spatial resolution, but
  lead to a high estimation bias at low coherence levels. The
  adaptive estimator is large when estimating low coherence values
  (to keep the estimation bias small) and small when estimating
  high coherence values.</p>

  <p>The local phase plane is considered in the coherence
  estimation if the input phase slope file is provided. The phase
  slope file can be generated suing the program <a href=
  "phase_slope.html">phase_slope</a>. If no such file is provided
  (i.e. if - is indicated on the command line instead of a valid
  file name) then it is assumed that the phase is constant within
  the estimation window. This assumption is not correct in sloped
  terrain resulting in an underestimation of the degree of
  coherence in sloped terrain.</p>

  <p>When providing a backscatter texture image (i.e. a valid file
  name is indicated on the command line and not - ) then the
  estimator window size is adaptive not only with respect to the
  initial coherence estimate but also to the backscatter texture.
  For high texture areas the coherence estimator window size is
  reduced. This adaptivity is motivated by the assumption of
  homogeneous targets within the estimation window.</p>

  <p>For areas of high coherence small estimation windows (near to
  the lower size bx_min) are used. For the estimation of low
  coherence values of areas with low texture large estimation
  windows (close to the upper window size bx_max) are used. For the
  estimation of low coherence values of areas with high texture
  intermediate to small estimation windows are used. In this case a
  somewhat higher estimation bias cannot be avoided.</p>

  <p>Constant weights or a gaussian weighting function may be
  selected and applied. Notice that the estimation is adaptive even
  with constant weights.</p>

  <p>Tests showed that the coherence estimates optained using the
  adaptive coherence estimation cc_ad makes an exellent compromise
  between maintaining a good spatial resolution and minimizing the
  estimation bias optained for small estimation windows. This
  allows a much improved interpretation of coherence values below
  about 0.4.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  The lower and upper limits used for the estimation window sizes
  may be specified.</p>

  <p><strong>DIAGNOSTICS</strong><br>
  All messages are generally self-explanatory.</p>

  <p><strong>NOTES</strong><br>
  Noisy phase slope estimates may have a negative effect on the
  coherence estimation. Such problems may be detected by comparison
  with coherence estimates without consideration of the local phase
  slope.</p>
