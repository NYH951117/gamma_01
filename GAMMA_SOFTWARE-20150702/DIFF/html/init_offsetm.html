  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>init_offsetm 19990421.mli 19990422.mli
  19990421_19990422.diff_par 3 3</samp></p>

  <p>Determines an initial registration offset (in slant range and
  azimuth) between the two indicated multilook intensity images
  19990421.mli and 19990422.mli</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">init_offsetm</span> reads two
  (multi-look) intensity images and the corresponding DIFF
  parameter file. For a multi-look intensity image at a user
  defined location, the two-dimensional cross correlation function
  is calculated and the peak of the correlation function yields an
  initial estimate of the offset between the images&nbsp; in slant
  range and azimuth.</p>

  <p>Confidence in the offset estimate is measured by comparing the
  height of the correlation peak relative to the average level of
  the correlation function to yield a correlation SNR. SNR values
  greater than 7.0 indicate registration estimates better than 0.5
  pixel.</p>

  <p>Due to low contrast some additional multi-looking of the
  images can improve the correlation between the images with some
  loss of resolution. Generally operating with <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">rlks=1</span> and <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">azlks = 1</span> is recommended.</p>

  <p>In some cases, when images have very few features, it may
  become difficult to find a region where a reliable offset can be
  measured. In this case, examine the image (for example with
  dispwr), and locate an area where there are discernible features
  such as lakes or mountains. Then note the range and azimuth
  coordinates. These coordinates can then be entered as the
  <span style="font-style: italic;">rpos</span> and <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">azpos</span> command line parameters so
  that the offset is estimated in the region containing the visible
  features. In the case of a relatively small feature, reduce the
  size of the patch to cover the area containing the feature. The
  patch size must be large enough to however take into account the
  range and azimuth offset between the 2 images.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  To optimize, both, robustness of the estimation as well as offset
  estimation accuracy, <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">init_offsetm</span> may be applied
  iteratively, starting with stronger multi-looking (such as 3x3)
  with consecutive reduction of the multi-looking to the full
  resolution (i.e. 1x1).</p>

  <p>In order to refine a geocoding lookup table, the offsets of a
  transformed image can be determined and used to refine the
  geocoding lookup table (program <a href=
  "gc_map_fine.html">gc_map_fine</a>). This is usually a simulated
  SAR intensity image as created with the program <a href=
  "geocode.html">geocode</a> or <a href=
  "pixel_area.html">pixel_area</a>.</p>

  <p>In measuring the offset, the transformed image (i.e. for
  example the simulated SAR image)should be taken as the reference
  geometry, in order to assure that the correct sign is used in the
  correction of the fine registration offsets. The user also has
  the option to copy the range and azimuth offsets to the offset
  polynomial constant terms. This is useful when performing a
  geocoding refinement and there are insufficient areas in the
  scene to generate an array of offsets. The user should select the
  <span style="font-style: italic;">rpos</span> and <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">azpos</span> parameters to match an area of
  the scene with contrast. Generally, the constant range and
  azimuth correction for the geocoding refinement is adequate.</p>

  <p>In cases where there are few features in the image, the user
  may select a smaller patch size using the patch command line
  parameter. Valid values for the the patch size are 128,256,512,
  and 1024.</p>
