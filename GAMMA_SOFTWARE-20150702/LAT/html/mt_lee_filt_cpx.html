  <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">mt_lee_filt_cpx</span> is
  derived from an algorithm for speckle reduction described in [1]
  by J.S. Lee et al. There are further earlier references give in
  [1] going back to 1998. This adaptive filter uses a set of 8 edge
  aligned window functions to select the homogeneous area
  associated with a particular pixel. The algorithm determines the
  window that best describes the region that a particular pixel
  belongs to. The deviation of center pixel relative to the average
  value over the selected window is used to determine a filter
  weighting factor that blends the local signal value with the
  average calculated using the window function. If the current
  pixel deviates strongly from the average of any edge aligned
  window function, very little or no filtering is applied. The
  algorithm determines both the best edge aligned filter and the
  weighting function. There are 8 edge aligned filters in 4 groups
  that are tested. The size of the window is either 7x7, 13x13 or
  19x19 samples and the window functions are:<br></p>

  <ol>
    <li>top half, bottom half</li>

    <li>left side, right-side</li>

    <li>upper right triangle, lower left triangle</li>

    <li>upper left triangle, lower right triangle</li>
  </ol>The window function is either 1 or 0. Those samples where
  the window function is 1, are averaged in the window, while those
  set to 0 are ignored. The filter output is a linear combination
  of the local value at position x,y in the reference image and the
  average over the filter window. The filter has the advantage that
  it is effective in preserving rapid variations in backscatter,
  yet strongly filtering speckle noise in homogeneous regions. The
  user can write out the filtered reference scene, the weighting
  coefficient beta, the index of the selected filter window, and
  the mean to sigma ratio as 32-bit float computers.<br>
  <br>
  An extension of the program is that the filter weight and index
  of the selected filter window are used to filter other scenes.
  Typically the reference scene used to compute the weighting
  coefficient and filter window is a multi-look sum and is very
  reliable. The other scenes are stored in a list. If there is a
  list of input data files, then there must be a list of the output
  file names provided by the user. The filter coefficients and the
  edge aligned filter number are then used to filter the entire
  stack of scenes.&nbsp; The user&nbsp; has the option to save the
  weighting factor, edge-aligned filter number, and the mean/sigma
  ratio.<br>
  <br>
  An example of a the filter action, we use a multi-look image of
  the Lost-Hills oil field in California. The scene pixel sample
  spacing is about 15 meters in range and azimuth. The reference
  image is an average of 24 scenes, with each of the 24 scenes
  containing 5 look pixels. However the images have relatively high
  interferometric correlation. In this example the effective number
  of looks parameter L is set to 48 and the window size to 7.&nbsp;
  In the case of a homogeneous region, the number of samples in the
  spatial average generated by this filter is approximately 24. The
  original and filtered images are shown below. Note that the
  filter preserves resolution while filtering homogeneous
  regions.<br>
