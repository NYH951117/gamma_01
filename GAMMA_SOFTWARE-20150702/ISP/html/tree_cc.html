  <p><i>ANSI-C program:</i> <a href=
  "../src/tree_cc.c"><i>tree_cc.c</i></a></p>

  <p><strong>NAME</strong><br>
  tree_cc - Uses the marked low correlation areas and residues
  (from the unwrapping flag file) and constructs a tree-like
  structure of branc cuts (walls). This branch cuts will not be
  crossed during the phase unwrapping. The walls are places that
  localize jumps of multiples of 2pi such as occur in regions of
  lay-over. The branch cuts are drawn been phase residues. These
  are points where the integral of phase around a path encircling
  the residue is a multiple of 2 pi.</p>

  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>tree_cc</em> reads unwrapping flag file and uses the low
  correlation areas and the residues to construct a tree-like
  structure. The tree-like structure will not be crossed during the
  phase unwrapping to localize phase jumps to the regions defined
  by the cuts. Both low-correlation areas and residues are
  considered in the construction of the trees. The trees are
  written into the unwrapping flag file. For each pixel a single
  byte consisting of 8 bits is stored in the flag file. Each bit is
  used to denote a property of that particular pixel such as if it
  is a residue. The meaning of the individual bits is explained in
  the <em>typedef_ISP.h</em> file. The information contained in the
  unwrapping can be displayed with the programs <em>disflag</em>
  and <em>rastree</em>.</p>

  <p><em>tree_cc</em> generates a tree consisting of branch cuts
  with a minimum of extra cuts to create a sparse network or
  <em>tree</em>. It does this by a progressive search, connecting
  to any residues encountered in the search. The search distance
  from each residue is increased at each step thereby increasing
  the search area until the tree has no net charge (neutralized).
  When a tree is neutral, the program proceeds to find the next
  residue in the image that has not yet been connected and
  neutralized. Older, neutral trees in the flag file are used as
  pathways to find residues not yet incorporated in the trees of
  the flag file. Closed tree loops are avoided. by preventing cuts
  back to the origin of the tree. It differs from <em>tree_gzw</em>
  in that when an old discharged tree is encountered, this tree is
  searched out exhaustively to find all the tree members prior to
  continue with search. This search operation can take a
  significant amount of time for large trees. Another feature of
  this program is that regions of low correlation, when encountered
  are search immediately for a residues of opposite charge,
  irrespective of the current branch length.</p>
