  1352_1610.off 1352_1610.offs 1352_1610.snr 4 8 1352_1610.offsets
  2 24 24 3.0</samp></p>

  <p>estimates range and azimuth registration offsets (offsets of
  1610.slc relative to 1352.slc) using the coherence optimization
  algorithm with 24 x 24 search windows of 4 pixels in range and 8
  pixels in azimuth. An oversampling with a factor of 2 is
  applied.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br></p>

  <p><em>offset_SLC</em> estimate the range and azimuth
  registration offset fields of a pair of SLC data using the
  coherence optimization algorithm.</p>

  <p>Throughout the image small SLC data chips are selected to
  determine the local registration range and azimuth offsets. For
  each such offset estimation a series of small interferograms with
  changing offset is constructed. The average coherence of these
  interferograms is estimated and a two-dimensional least squares
  fit is used to determine the location of the coherence maximum at
  sub-pixel accuracy.</p>

  <p>The optimum size of the range and azimuth search window
  searches out a region, large enough to handle the different
  offsets in the image, yet small enough so that the program
  execution is not prohibitively long. Typically, large baselines
  lead to larger changes in range and azimuth offset of the image.
  Already existing information on the range and azimuth offset is
  used to guide this search. Such information is found in already
  existing range and azimuth offset polynomials found in the ISP
  offset/processing parameter file (estimated for example with the
  program <em>offset_pwr</em> which can easily handle much larger
  search windows.</p>

  <p>This method of measuring offsets between SLC images is
  complementary to the intensity correlation method used in
  <em>offset_pwr</em>. For identical search windows
  <em>offset_SLC</em> takes significantly longer to execute than
  <em>offset_pwr</em>, but has the advantage that the offset is
  actually based on the interferometric phase coherence. Another
  advantage is that the program can find offsets in areas with
  essentially no features at all such as snow fields where
  <em>offset_pwr</em> might&nbsp; fail.</p>

  <p>Relatively small search windows and interferogram chip sizes
  are recommended to increase the efficiency of the algorithm. The
  coordinates of the image section selected to be processed are
  relative to SLC-1. For most cases a SNR threshold of 3.0 for the
  acceptance of an offset leads to good results. In cases of too
  low coherence the use of an intensity based algorithm is
  recommended, as supported by the programs <em>offset_pwr</em>a
  and <em>offset_pwr_tracking</em>. But notice that not the average
  coherence is essential. Local high coherence, for example in
  urban areas distributed throughout the image, may be sufficient
  for <em>offset_SLC</em> to find a sufficient number of valid
  offsets.</p>

  <p>Oversampling rates of 1 (no oversampling), 2, 4&nbsp; are
  supported. Usually the default oversampling rate of 2 leads
  already yields&nbsp; very accurate offset estimates.<br>
  The offset for the fringe visiblity&nbsp; maximum is estimated
  using a two-dimensional least squares fit.</p>

  <p>The coarse range and azimuth offsets of SLC-2 relative to
  SLC-1 for the entire image are required. This can be done
  manually by comparison of image features, or using the program
  <a href="init_offset.html">init_offset</a>. The number of image
  chips used and the search window size can be selected in the the
  ISP offset/processing parameter file. Recommended values are
  suggested as default values in the program
  <em>create_offset</em>.Only samples with fringe SNR above a
  selected threshold are saved in the offset data file
  (<em>&lt;pair&gt;.offs</em>) as pairs of floating point numbers
  and and optionally printed in the text file
  (<em>&lt;pair&gt;.offsets</em>). Each line of the text file
  consists of the range and azimuth coordinates azimuth, the range
  and azimuth offset estimates at that point, and the estimation
  SNR</p>

  <p>The program <a href="offset_fit.html">offset_fit</a> is used
  to cull the offset field and use the least squares derived
  polynomial fit for the offset between the two SLC images. The
  model is then used to calculate the interferogram.</p>

  <p><b>OPTIONS</b></p>

  <p>The offset estimation programs use already existing range and
  azimuth offset polynomials found in the ISP offset/interferogram
  parameter file to improve its initial registration offset guess.
  An iterative use of this feature allows to optimize the
  efficiency and accuracy of the registration offset estimation.
  After an initial offset estimation from the orbit parameters
  (<a href="init_offset_orbit.html">init_offset_orbit</a>) or the
  data itself (<a href="init_offset.html">init_offset</a> a first
  offset polynomial is determined based on estimates calculated
  with <a href="offset_pwr.html">offset_pwr</a> which are efficient
  using large search windows. With these quite accurate
  registration polynomials <a href=
  "offset_SLC_tracking.html">offset_SLC_tracking</a> or <a href=
  "offset_pwr_tracking.html">offset_pwr_tracking</a> can then be
  run efficiently on many locations throuoghout the image, using
  small search windows.</p>
