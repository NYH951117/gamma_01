  the indicated range and azimuth spacings. Point 125677 is used as
  reference and the phase at this reference point is the initial
  value is set to 0.0. The mask raster file has 1 range look and 5
  azimuth looks relative to the SLC coordinates</p><samp>mcf_pt pt

  <p>Conducts MCF phase unwrapping for all records of the input
  stack of interferograms. Point masks (pmask3) alone determines
  which points are considered. Uniform weights are used. The
  distances used in the cost calculations consider the indicated
  range and azimuth spacings. Point 125677 is used as reference and
  the phase at this reference point is the initial value is set to
  0.0.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  mcf_pt conducts Minimum Cost flow (MCF) phase unwrapping for
  interferograms in point data format. This can be done for a
  single record of the stack of interferograms or all records.</p>

  <p>The coordinates of the points considered are defined in the
  point list. The optional mask file (in point data format)
  indicates for each point if it is valid (1, i.e. considered) or
  not valid (0, excluded). In addition, a mask can be provided in
  2-D raster format. Points in areas of 0 value are excluded.</p>

  <p>The input interferograms are provided as a point data stack.
  This stack is of fcomplex type. The type of the output stack of
  unwrapped interferograms is of float format.</p>

  <p>Unwrapped phases are calculated for each valid point of the
  point list. Valid points are points with a non-zero input
  interferogram value, a non-zero point mask value (if provided),
  and a non-zero raster mask value (if provided).</p>

  <p>The unwrapping is conducted for the valid points of a single
  record. Delaunay triangulation is used to generate an optimized
  irregular triangular network of the points to be unwrapped.</p>

  <p>The minimum cost flow (MCF) algorithm is used to minimize the
  total cost associated with phase discontinuities in the scene
  associated with noise, and layover. The user supplies weights
  (usually related to the spatial coherence) used to calculate
  where discontinuities (i.e. network flow) are preferred. Regions
  of low weight have low costs for phase jumps whereas areas of
  high cost tend to exclude such discontinuies in the unwrapped
  phase.</p>

  <p>Each triangle is a node in the network. If integration of the
  phase around a triangle indicates a a positive phase disconituity
  (residue) then the node is marked as contributing flow to the
  network. A negative phase discontinuity at a node is marked as
  accepting flow from the network. The cost of flow in an arc
  connecting adjacent nodes is derived from the weight factors
  provided. In full 2-D interferograms typically, the
  interferometric correlation is used as weight file. For isolated
  points this maz not be an appropriate measure. The weight may
  also be set to a uniform factor.</p>

  <p>The MCF algorithm solves for the flow in the arcs that
  minimizes the net cost. The implemented MCF solution is based on
  the successive shortest path (SSP) method.</p>

  <p>The unwrapped phases are written to the output point data
  stack of unwrapped phases at the indicated record number.</p>

  <p>If a new output stack name is indicated the stack is created.
  Indicating a record number larger than the highest record number
  of the indicated stack results in an increase of the stack
  size.</p>

  <p>An alternative to the "spatial" unwrapping supported by mcf_pt
  is the unwrapping through the baseline-time-regression analysis
  as supported by def_mod_pt and multi_def_pt. The advantage of
  mcf_pt is that it is also feasible for small number of
  interferometric pairs. For very large stacks def_mod_pt and
  multi_def_pt are preferred.</p>

  <p>The reliability of mcf_pt is improved if differential
  interferograms are unwrapped. The better the model subtracted the
  more robust the unwrapping. In the case that the interferogram is
  within PI/2 of the simulated phase (model) another alternative
  for the unwrapping is unw_model_pt.</p>

  <p>To display the complex or real valued input or output
  interferograms contained in the point data stack the programs
  pt2data or pt2d can be used to convert the point data to raster
  data format which can then be displayed using conventional
  display programs.</p>
