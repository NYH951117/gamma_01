  <p>Estimates range and azimuth offset fields (offsets of
  19990915.slc relative to&nbsp; 19991020.slc) using the coherence
  tracking algorithm using a 5 x 25 pixels search chip size and a 3
  x 15 pixel search region size. An oversampling with a factor of 2
  is applied. The search is repeated every 10 range and every 20
  azimuth pixels, for the indicated reference image section.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>offset_SLC_tracking</em> estimates range and azimuth offset
  fields of a pair of SLC in support of image co-registration and
  offset tracking.</p>

  <p>The coherence tracking algorithm is used. In the coherence
  tracking algorithm is also called fringe visibility optimization.
  Throughout the image SLC data windows are selected at regular
  intervals. The azimuth and range offset of SLC-2 relative to
  SLC-1 is measured for each window position using fringe
  visibility.&nbsp; For each such offset estimation window a series
  of small interferogram chips with different offsets of SLC-2
  relative to SLC-1. A 2-D array of coherence values of the
  interferogram chips is determined as a function of range and
  azimuth offsets. A two-dimensional least squares fit is performed
  on the coherence values to determine the location of the peak
  coherence with sub-pixel accuracy.&nbsp; As a quality measure,
  the SNR of the offset estimate is also determined.</p>

  <p>The range and azimuth size of the rectangular chips used in
  the calculation of the chip interferograms can be specified.
  Furthermore, the range and azimuth size of the search region used
  can also be specified on the command line. Very often only very
  small offsets are expected. Selecting a relatively small search
  region size makes the method more robust and faster. The search
  region indicated is often smaller than the search chip size. The
  search is centered at the offsets indicated in the offset
  polynomials of the provided offset parameter file.</p>

  <p>The optimum size of the range and azimuth search window
  searches out a region, large enough to handle the different
  offsets in the image, yet small enough so that the program
  execution is not prohibitively long. Already existing information
  on the range and azimuth offset is used to guide this search.
  Such information is found in already existing range and azimuth
  offset polynomials found in the ISP offset/processing parameter
  file (estimated for example with the program <em>offset_pwr</em>
  which can easily handle much larger search windows.</p>

  <p>The size of the search chips selected needs to be in-line with
  the features that shall be used in the matching. For small
  windows finding good matches depends on finding the same speckle
  in the two SLC which means that coherence is required. For larger
  windows features of a larger size are relevant. Offsets are
  calculated for the indicated section of the reference SLC (SLC1)
  at the indicated range and azimuth step. The related information
  is documented in the offset parameter file.</p>

  <p>For most cases a SNR threshold of 3.0 for the acceptance of an
  offset leads to good results. In cases of too low coherence the
  use of an intensity based algorithm is recommended, as supported
  by the programs <em>offset_pwr_tracking</em>.</p>

  <p>Oversampling rates of 1 (no over-sampling), 2, and&nbsp; 4
  supported. Usually an over-sampling rate of 2 is sufficient to
  obtain very accurate offset estimates.<br>
  The offset for the coherence maximum is estimated using a
  two-dimensional least squares function fit.</p>

  <p>For a detailed investigation with many offsets estimated it is
  strongly recommended to provide offset polynomials in the offset
  parameter file. These polynomials are typically determined using
  the programs <a href="offset_pwr.html">offset_pwr</a> and
  <a href="offset_fit.html">offset_fit</a>.</p>

  <p>The estimated offset fields and related matching SNR values
  are written to binary output files of fcomplex (*.offs) and float
  (*.snr) format. The offsets can be converted to offsets in the
  original (reference) geometry using the program <a href=
  "offset_tracking.html">offset_tracking</a>. Or the program
  <a href="offset_fit.html">offset_fit</a> is used to cull the
  offset field and use the least squares derived polynomial fit for
  the offset between the two SLC images.</p>

  <p>No search is conducted for chips with a NULL value in the
  center of the search chips. Setting the SLC values of areas which
  are not of interest to the NULL value may permit to strongly
  reduce the required processing time, while still covering the
  area of interest at high spatial resolution (small range and
  azimuth step).</p>

  <p>The binary offsets file (*.offs) contains offsets in SAR image
  pixels (of the reference image) in fcomplex format. The real
  parts correspond to range offsets and the imaginary parts to
  azimuth offsets. The positions of the offset estimates are
  defined by the starting range and azimuth positions and the range
  and azimuth steps, as documented in the offset parameter
  file.</p>

  <p><b>OPTIONS</b><br>
  Range and azimuth chip sizes, range and azimuth steps, and range
  and azimuth search regions can all be indicated on the command
  line, permitting for example to use search chips, search windows,
  and steps which are larger in azimuth directions as may be
  appropriate considering the different ground-range and azimuth
  sampling of most SLC data.</p>
