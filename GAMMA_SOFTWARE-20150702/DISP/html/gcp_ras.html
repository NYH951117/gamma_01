  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>gcp_ras 1352_1610.flt.ras 1352_1610.gcp</samp></p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>gcp_ras</em> reads and displays an image in SUN raster or BMP
  format. It can be used to select ground control points for
  precise estimate of the interferometric baseline for repeat track
  interferometry (RTI). Heights of the GCPs are derived from
  topographic maps or GPS ground measurements. In this application
  the reference image is generally of a flattened interferogram</p>

  <p>The data entered using <em>gcp_ras</em> are stored in a text
  format file that can be edited using a text editor if necessary.
  The file format consists of columns of numbers containing the GCP
  number, x (cross-track) pixel coordinate, y (along-track) line
  number, and the entered data. Each GCP has a single line entry in
  the file.</p>

  <p>Using the program is simple. Different mouse buttons perform
  different functions. Pressing the left button of the mouse allows
  viewing the area around the cursor in a zoom window. GCP points
  are selected by pressing the right mouse button. A red cross
  appears at the selected point and the data entry window becomes
  active (able to accept input). It is permitted to move the
  initial point location by right clicking another point. Only when
  Once a desired point is selected, enter the height for that point
  in the data entry window. Hitting the enter key writes the
  coordinates and entered data to the GCP file. When finished with
  data entry click the close button to exit. If you have been
  working on a GCP list you can append additional GCP points by
  simply rerunning the application. The previously entered points
  will be drawn on the image</p>

  <p>&nbsp;The heights, not the true horizontal position is
  required in the calculation of the interferometric baseline. At
  least 20 control points at various altitudes are recommended to
  obtain a reasonable baseline estimate.</p>

  <p>The next step in using the ground control points is to extract
  values of the phase corresponding to the GCPs from an unwrapped
  interferogram. This is done using program <em>gcp_phase.</em> The
  output of <em>gcp_phase</em> is text format file with an
  additional column containing the unwrapped phase values. This
  file in turn is used as input to program <em>base_ls</em> to
  estimate the baseline.</p>
