  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>S1_poly_overlap 20141003.SLC_tab 10 2
  20141003.burst_overlap.poly 1</samp></p>

  <p>Determines a polygon file (ASCII), with polygons for all burst
  overlap regions (expressed in the indicated multi-look
  geometry).</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>S1_poly_overlap</em> is used to defnie polgons for the burst
  or sub-wath overlap regions of a S1 IWS burst SLC. The geometry
  of the S1 IWS burst SLC is available from the TOPS_par files for
  the different sub-swaths included. The TOPS_par files are found
  in the SLC_tab indicated on the command line.</p>

  <p>Polygon files can be used to modify the image data in the
  polgon areas. Specifically, this is used to set the
  co-registration lookup table values to zero (NULL = no data) in
  <a href="S1_coreg_TOPS.html">S1_coreg_TOPS</a>. As a consequence
  only the burst overlap areas are resampled when running <a href=
  "SLC_interp_S1_TOPS.html">SLC_interp_S1_TOPS</a> with the masked
  looklup table - which is substantially faster. To do this the
  same multi-looking in range and azimuth has to be indicated as
  for the calculation of the MLI mosaic geometry used in the lookup
  table calculation (e.g. 10 range x 2 azimuth looks)</p>

  <p><em>S1_poly_overlap</em> is used in the co-registration
  procedure supported by <a href=
  "S1_coreg_TOPS.html">S1_coreg_TOPS</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br></p>

  <p><em>S1_poly_overlap</em> can also be used to define the
  overlap areas between the adjacent sub-swaths of a burst SLC.</p>
