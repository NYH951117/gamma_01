  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <br>
  <code><samp>atm_ad_pt pt pmask2 itab pres patm_ad 2
  140</samp></code></p>

  <p>Conducts a temporal filtering of the point data stack
  containing the residual phase <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">pres</span> to obtain an atmospheric phase
  screen estimate.&nbsp; Records which are at most +/-140 days away
  from the current record,&nbsp; Linear least-squares filtering is
  used. &nbsp;If there are insufficient records within the
  specified time span, then the input record is copied to the
  output</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">atm_ad_pt</span> supports
  adaptive temporal filtering of point data stacks. The records to
  be considered in the filtering can be indicated through the
  maximum difference in record time and maximum number of records
  considered, or just one of the two criteria by selecting all
  records in the other criteria. The important point is that the
  data from the central day are excluded from the estimate to
  suppress large atmospheric excursions that occur at that specific
  time.</p>Together with the point list a point data stack of mask
  values can be indicated to consider or ignore specific points.
  "-" can be indicated instead a <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">pmask</span> file to consider all points of
  the list. The format of the output point data stack with the
  filtered values has the same type as the input point data stack.

  <p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">itab</span> is required
  to associate the interferogram stack records with pairs of SLC
  stack records. Only valid points, i.e. points with a non-zero
  value in the mask are considered. For points with a zero in the
  mask the output is set to the NULL value 0.</p>

  <p>Several options are available for performing the filtering.
  Filter modes modes 0 and 1 produce output values that are
  weighted sums of the input data that are within the local
  temporal window specified by the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">dtmax</span> parameter. Either constant or
  triangular weighting can be selected.&nbsp;<br></p>

  <p>For data that are floating point, filtering using linear
  least-squares&nbsp; (LS) estimation is an option. A linear
  regression of the values within the temporal window is performed.
  This mode has the advantage of reducing errors at the beginning
  and end of the time series and where there is sparse unevenly
  sampled data. The bias is reduced by predicting the estimate at
  the desired time using the linear trend.&nbsp; In the case of
  NULL values in the input point data stack,&nbsp; the records
  considered are not redefined. The temporal filtering is correctly
  done for these fewer points (i.e. considering the missing values
  in the normalization).</p>

  <p>The delta-time considered for each record is the time
  difference (in days) between the slave and master SLC as
  specified in the <span style="font-style: italic;">itab</span>
  file. In the case of a stack with all records having the same SLC
  reference this corresponds to a temporal filtering considering
  the time of the slave SLC.<br></p>

  <p>There is the option to provide a text file containing the
  standard deviation of the phase values in each layer. The
  variation on the phase of each layer can be attributed to
  atmospheric noise. When these phase values are provided for float
  data (unwrapped phase), the standard deviation for each
  layer&nbsp; is used to weight the data in the least-squares
  smoothing. In this way layers with large atmospheric variation
  have less influance relative to layers with lower levels of
  atmospheric noise.<br>
  <br>
  The standard deviation of each layer can be calculated by the
  program <a href="stat_pt.html">stat_pt</a>. The text file output
  by stat_pt has 3 entries on each line, the first is the layer
  number followed by the mean and the standard deviation of the
  point data in that layer.</p>
