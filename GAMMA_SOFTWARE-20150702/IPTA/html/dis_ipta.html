  <p>Displays the SUN/BMP rasterfile testsite.pt.ras which shows
  the point locations, and conducts for the interactively selected
  pairs of points (one is the reference point) an investigation of
  the baseline and time dependence of the differential
  interferometric phase (relative to the phase of the reference
  point), estimates height corrections, linear deformation rates,
  and a quality measure for the regression, and displays the phase
  values together with the regression function.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  dis_ipta is a tool for a point-wise investigation of the baseline
  and time dependence of the differential interferometric phase
  (relative to the phase of the reference point).</p>

  <p>Interactively, pairs of points are selected in the displayed
  SUN/BMP rasterfile testsite.pt.ras which shows the point
  locations. For the selected pairs of points (one is the reference
  point) an 2-D linear regression function (linear dependences on
  the perpendicular baseline and time differences) is determined
  for the differential interferometric phase (relative to the phase
  of the reference point). Height corrections, linear deformation
  rates, and the standard deviation of the phase from the fit as a
  quality measure for the regression, are calculated. Plots showing
  the phase values together with the regression function are
  displayed.</p>

  <p>In the regression analysis either a one dimensional (linear
  dependence on perpendicular baseline component) or two
  dimensional (linear dependences on perpendicular baseline
  component and linear deformation rate) linear regression function
  is used. In this regression analysis it is accounted for that
  wrapped phases are provided in the case of a complex valued
  interferogram.</p>

  <p>The slopes of the regression functions determined are directly
  related to the relative height correction, also called delta
  height value, and the linear deformation rate.<br>
  The standard deviation from the regression function serves as a
  quality measure for the regression function and the derived
  parameters. The standard deviation of the phase from the
  regression funnction is expressed in radian. As input to dis_ipta
  interferometric data in point data format is
  required.&nbsp;<br></p>

  <p>The point coordinates are defined in a point list. Optionally,
  a point data stack of interpolated point target positions can be
  provided. If not provided, the point coordinates of the point
  list are used. Furthermore, a mask can be provided to indicate
  for each point if it shall be considered (mask value 1) or not
  (mask value 0). The interferometric pairs are defined in the
  itab, a table associating interferogram stack records with pairs
  of SLC stack records (ascii). Acquisition times and other SLC
  parameters are provided in the stack of SLC/MLI parameters
  (binary) and baseline parameters in the stack of baseline
  parameters (binary). The differential interferogram is provided
  in a point data stack. Complex valued or unwrapped differential
  interferograms can be provided (but the same type for all
  records). Typically, simulated interferometric phase images were
  subtracted in the calculation of the stack of differential
  interferograms. Early on in an IPTA investigation initial
  simulated phases may contain only the topographic and orbital
  phase terms calculated from an initial DEM and initial baseline
  estimates from orbit data. Later on improved height values,
  precision baselines, atmospheric corrections, linear deformation
  trends etc. may be considered.</p>

  <p>On the command line a number of parameters can be indicated to
  configure and optimize the regression analysis. These parameters
  are discussed in the following.</p>

  <p>For the interferometric baselines it can be indicated if the
  initial estimate or the precision estimate shall be used.</p>

  <p>In the case of the wrapped phase values the regression
  analysis is done in two steps. The best regression function among
  a predefined set of functions is determined. In a second step the
  least squares analysis is conducted. The predefined regression
  functions for the first step are derived based on the indicated
  maximum height correction and maximum deformation rate difference
  values indicated. Indicating larger values means that more
  predefined regression functions are tested which will make the
  process slower. Indicating a too small value may result in
  failure to resolve the regression for a point with a high height
  correction or deformation rate value. It has to be kept in mind
  that the height correction and deformation rates are relative to
  the reference point. Consequently, the regression analysis is
  generally more robust for points near the reference point.</p>

  <p>The records considered in the regression analysis can be
  constrained to short perpendicular baselines and short time
  intervals.</p>

  <p>Either one- or two-dimensional linear regression models can be
  used. A reason for using the one-dimensional regression model
  might be to make the regression more robust in the case of only
  few data records or early on in the analysis when the large
  height corrections are expected.</p>

  <p>The slope of the phase to baseline dependence is used to
  calculate a height correction value. This height correction value
  is the height correction of the current point under the
  assumption that the height of the reference point is correct. The
  height corrections are indicated in meter (m) and are written to
  the screen. It is important to note that this improvement is done
  relative to the selected reference point. The accuracy of the
  height of a specific point depends on the accuracy of the height
  of the reference point plus the error in the height correction
  (and not only the second term).</p>

  <p>The slope of the phase to time dependence is used to calculate
  a linear deformation rate. This linear deformation rate is the
  deformation rate of the current point relative to the reference
  point. The deformation rates are indicated in meter per year
  (m/year) and are written to the screen. It is important to note
  that the linear deformation rate is relative to the reference
  point and in addition to any deformation model which may already
  be considered in the calculation of the differential
  interferogram.</p>

  <p>The residual phase, i.e. the difference between the phase
  values and the regression model includes terms related to
  atmospheric delay, non-linear deformation, baseline errors, and
  signal noise.<br>
  For each point the standard deviation of the (unwrapped) phases
  from the regressin function is calculated and used as measure for
  the quality of the regression.</p>

  <p>To select point pairs in the display visible after starting
  dis_ipta, the cursor is moved near the desired points which can
  then be selected using the right mouse bottons. Doubble clicking
  is used to select a (new) reference point, single clicking to
  select a (new) point. Upon the selection the regression analysis
  is done for the selected pair and the result is displayed.</p>

  <p>To automatically conduct the same type of regression analysis
  for all points of an image is supported by the programs
  def_mod_pt and multi_def_pt.</p>
