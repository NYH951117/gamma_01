  <p>Calculates the 3D displacement field based on the indicated

  indicated direction field (along height gradient). The output
  displacement field is expressed through the norm, the elevation
  angle (theta) and the orientation angle (phi).</p>

  <p><samp>dispmap_vec aoi.dem_par aoi.disp aoi.lv_theta aoi.lv_phi
  aoi.grad_theta aoi.grad_phi aoi.disp_norm - - aoi.disp_x
  aoi.disp_y aoi.disp_z</samp></p>

  <p>Calculates the 3D displacement field based on the indicated
  DINSAR based line-of-sight displacement component and the
  indicated direction field (along height gradient). The output
  displacement field is expressed through the easting (x), northing
  (y) and vertical (z) components.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  dispmap_vec calculates the displacement vector field based on the
  indicated DINSAR based component and displacement direction
  field. The main application is in landslides and glacier motion
  monitoring where the assumption of motion along the gradient of
  the topograpic height is an often used assumption. The program
  permits to calculate the 3D displacement vector field from the
  DINSAR result (which provides only the displacement component in
  the direction of the SAR look vector and the displacement
  direction field (derived e.g. using the assumption of flow along
  the height gradient).</p>

  <p>The dimensions of the image files and the map projection which
  is the reference are defined in the DEM/map parameter file.</p>

  <p>Differential interferometry permits to estimate the
  deformation component in the SAR look direction. This DINSAR
  based information is specified through the displacement component
  in the look direction and the direction angles (elevation theta
  and orientation phi) in the map geometry. The look vector
  direction angles can be determined using the program <a href=
  "look_vector.html">look_vector</a>.</p>

  <p>The motion or flow direction is indicated through the related
  direction angles (elevation theta and orientation phi). For the
  case of motion along the surface height gradient the flow
  direction field can be calculated based on a DEM using the
  program <a href="dem_gradient.html">dem_gradient</a>.</p>

  <p>The output displacement vector is available as displacement
  norm, elevation and orientation angles, or as easting (x),
  northing (y) and vertical (up) components, stored in separate
  binary files (float).</p>

  <p>Notice that the displacement vector components (norm,
  elevation and orientation angle) will differ from the indicated
  flow direction field because for "negative" displacements along
  the indicated direction (different sign of vector).</p>

  <p>The elevation angle is defined as the angle between the
  horizontal surface and the look vector with positive angles
  indicating sensor positions above the surface. The orientation
  angle is defined as the angle between the East direction and the
  projection of the look vector on the horizontal surface plan. The
  orientation angle increases towards north, with the North
  direction corresponding to PI/2 (and south to -PI/2). Both angles
  are expressed in radian.</p>

  <p>Warning: the interferometric observation is only sensitive to
  motion in the SAR look vector direction. For other directions the
  sensitivity is reduced which will lead to higher errors.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  Other flow direction fields (than the DEM gradient field)
  calculated from geophysical (or geometrical models) can be used.
  Nevertheless, no specific programs are currently included to
  calculate the related direction fields.</p>
