  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>base_init 1352.slc.par 1610.slc.par 1352_1610.off
  1352_1610.int 1352_1610.base 2</samp></p>

  <p>The baseline component parallel to the look vector is
  estimated based on the orbit parameters in 1352.slc.par and
  1610.slc.par, the baseline component perpendicular to the look
  vector is estimated based on the interferogram fringe frequency
  (using fft techniques).</p>

  <p><samp>base_init 1352.slc.par 1610.slc.par - - 1352_1610.base
  0</samp></p>

  <p>The baseline is estimated based on the orbit parameters in
  1352.slc.par and 1610.slc.par.</p>

  <p><samp>base_init 1352.slc.par 1610.slc.par 1352_1610.off -
  1352_1610.base 1</samp></p>

  <p>The baseline is estimated based on the orbit parameters on the
  SLC registration offsets, respectively based on the range and
  azimuth pixel spacing scale factors in the case of slc which were
  registered to a common geometry.</p>

  <p><samp>base_init 1352.slc.par - - 1352_1610.int 1352_1610.base
  4</samp></p>

  <p>The baseline component parallel to the look vector is not
  estimated (set to 0.0), the baseline component perpendicular to
  the look vector is estimated based on the interferogram fringe
  frequency (using fft techniques).</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  base_init estimates the interferometric baseline.</p>

  <p>The estimated baseline and (along track) baseline rate, in TCN
  coordinates, is written to the first two lines of the <a href=
  "baseline_file.html">baseline file</a>. The baseline components
  parallel and perpendicular to the look vector are written to
  stdout.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve on one hand a high applicability and on
  the other hand high quality estimates several baseline estimation
  algortihms are included. The included algorithms allow to
  estimate the interferometric baseline and the (along track) rate
  of change of the interferometric baseline from:<br>
  - the orbit state vectors<br>
  - the SLC registration offsets<br>
  - the interferogram fringe rate<br></p>

  <p>In practice it turns out that it is usually best to combine
  two of these methods. The first two methods give the better
  estimates for the parallel baseline component. The third method
  gives very often the better estimate for the perpendicular
  baseline component. Therefore, it is recommended to combine
  either one of the first two methods with the third method.</p>

  <p>In order to allow this the user can select between the
  individual methods and combined methods as listed in the table
  below.</p>

  <p>Names for input files which are not required for a selected
  method can be replaced by a - sign. The program checks if the
  selected method is possible with the provided data. If that's not
  the case it automatically selects an alternative method which for
  which the required input data is provided.</p>

  <p>As an option the user can select the range and azimuth fft
  sizes used for the determination of the fringe frequency. Notice,
  that the fringe frequency estimation is done iteratively to
  ensure maximum reliability of the perpendicular baseline
  component which is so important in SAR interferometry.</p>

  <p>A large range fft size will reduce the accuracy of the first
  Bperp estimation because of its slant range dependence. In the
  iteration the interferogram is flattened with the prior baseline
  estimate which will remove this problem, in particular if a
  relatively accurate Bperp estimate is used. As a consequence the
  combined methods with such relatively accurate Bperp estimates
  (originating from an other method) lead to the best results.</p>

  <p>In the fringe rate method the assumption that the surface on
  the average flat for the fft window is used. If that's not the
  case the Bperp estimation will be slightly wrong and there will
  be a residual phase trend in a flattened interferogram. If the
  user knows that the surface is flat for a certain part of the
  scene he may select this location for the fft baseline
  estimation. The baseline parameter file will be used for the
  removal of the average phase trend of the interferogram and for
  the computation of height and slope. The initial baseline
  estimation can be improved based on ground control points using
  the program <a href="base_ls.html">base_ls</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  none</p>

  <p><strong>NOTES</strong><br>
  The program base_init replaces the programs <em>base_orbit</em>
  and <em>base_est_fft</em> of earlier ISP versions. The capability
  of these older baseline estimation programs has been fully
  integrated into <em>base_init</em>.</p>
