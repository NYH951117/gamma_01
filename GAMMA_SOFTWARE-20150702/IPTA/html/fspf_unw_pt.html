  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>fspf_unw_pt pt pmask1 08256.rslc.par pdiff punw1.spf 321 14
  2 500 2 1</samp></p>Conducts a fast spatial filtering and phase
  unwrapping of record 14 of the input point data stack pdiff
  (fcomplex). Points within a radius of 500 SLC range samples are
  taken into account for the the spatial filtering of each point.
  The spatial filter type chosen is a quadratic weighted average (1
  - (r/r_max)**2). The phase of point number 321 is taken as a
  reference for phase unwrapping. For the MCF phase unwrapping the
  input unwrapped phase values are weighted according to the
  intensity of the filtered complex interferogram. The unwrapped
  phase values are written to the point data stack punw1.spf
  (float).<samp>fspf_unw_pt pt pmask1 08256.rslc.par pdiff
  punw1.spf 321 - 2 500 2</samp>

  <p>Same as above except that (1) the filtering and phase
  unwrapping is performed for all data records of the point stack
  and that (2) the unwrapped phase values receive a uniform
  weighting for the MCF phase unwrapping procedure.</p>

  <p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong><br>
  Source code fspf_unw_pt.c in ./IPTA/src, executable version
  fspf_unw_pt in ./IPTA/bin</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  In the estimation of orbital phase trends and long-wavelength
  atmospheric path delays complex valued point data layers need to
  be spatial filtered with large filter windows followed by
  unwrapping using the minimum cost flow algorithm. This can be
  done using spf_pt and mcf_pt, but this sequence is very slow for
  large filter windows. Applying similar filtering as supported in
  fspf_pt followed by unwrapping of the multi-looked filtered data
  using the minimum cost flow algorithm computationally much more
  efficient. fspf_unw_pt is of interest in the estimation of
  residual (unwrapped) orbital phases and long-wavelength
  atmospheric phases for the complex valued point differential
  interferograms of from rewrapped residual phases from a
  regression analysis.<br></p>

  <p>fspf_unw_pt combines fast spatial filtering and Minimum Cost
  flow (MCF) phase unwrapping of the filtered complex interferogram
  for point data stacks. Either one or all records can be filtered
  and unwrapped. The filter size used can be indicated through the
  spatial radius (indicated in range samples). The filtering done
  before the phase unwrapping corresponds to the program <a href=
  "fspf_pt.html">fspf_pt</a>. The phase unwrapping, however, is
  then done in the multilook geometry.<br></p>

  <p>Together with the point list a point mask file can be
  indicated to consider or ignore specific points. "-" can be
  indicated instead a pmask file to consider all points of the
  list. fspf_unw_pt provides fast spatial filtering and phase
  unwrapping of large point lists.<br></p>

  <p>Either one record or all records can be filtered and
  unwrapped. To select all records in the stack enter "-" for the
  record number. Different format types (0:fcomplex 1:scomplex
  2:float, default -: float) are supported. The format of the
  output point data stack with the filtered values has the same
  type as the input point data stack.<br></p>

  <p>The SLC parameter file associated with the point list
  coordinate geometry is required to calculate the ground distances
  between pairs of points. Such distances are calculated using the
  ground range sampling (calculated from slant range sampling and
  incidence angle) and the azimuth spacing. The maximum search area
  radius is indicated in SLC range samples. Only valid points, i.e.
  points with a non-zero value in the mask are considered. For
  points with a zero in the mask the output is set to the NULL
  value.<br></p>

  <p>For the spatial filtering constant weights, a linearly
  decreasing ramp (linear with ground distance), a quadratic, or a
  Gaussian distance-weighed average can be selected. Points with
  NULL values in the input data are not considered in the search
  for the nearest points (they are not counted as points in the
  filtering).<br></p>

  <p>The minimum cost flow (MCF) algorithm is used to minimize the
  total cost associated with phase discontinuities in the scene
  associated with noise, and layover. The user may supplies weights
  in the form of intensity values of the spatially filtered complex
  interferogram by setting the weighting mode flag to 1. The
  weights are used to calculate where discontinuities (i.e. network
  flow) are preferred. Regions of low weight have low costs for
  phase jumps whereas areas of high cost tend to exclude such
  discontinuies in the unwrapped phase. See also <a href=
  "mcf_pt.html">mcf_pt</a> for more information on MCF phase
  unwrapping.<br></p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  none.
