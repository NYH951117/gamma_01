  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>sp_stat 08456.rslc 08456.sp_stat.pwr 08456.sp_stat.cc
  08456.sp_stat.MSR testsite.plist 1000 10. 0.4 1.2 4 4 - - - - 4 4
  1</samp></p>

  <p>Generates a point list of coordinates of points with a low
  spectral diversity (i.e. high spectral correlation value) and a
  dominant intensity. The image files 08456.sp_stat.pwr,
  08456.sp_stat.cc, and 08456.sp_stat.MSR are generated for visual
  control of the features used in the identification of the
  points.</p>

  <p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong><br>
  Source code sp_stat.c in ./IPTA/src, executable version sp_stat
  in ./IPTA/bin</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  In the IPTA point lists contain the coordinates (range and
  azimuth pixel number relative to the reference SLC geometry) of
  the selected points. Data at these points (SLC values,
  interferogram values, ...) are stored in point data stacks with
  each record corresponding to a different SLC or interferogram.
  The point data stack of mask values contains for each point a
  flag (0 or 1) which indicates if the data of a point are
  considered (1) or not considered (0).</p>

  <p>sp_stat supports the generation of lists of points with "point
  target characteristics". This is done based on a single SLC image
  based on the spectral diversity. Only for point targets it is
  expected that the energy remains more or less the same when
  processing different looks with fractional azimuth and range
  bandwidth. Based on this low spectral diversity, respectivity
  based on correlation values above the indicated threshold
  potential point targets can be identified. As additional criteria
  a dominent intensity, i.e. pwr relative to an average power is
  above a given threshold, and a high mean to sigma ratio (MSR)
  between the spectral looks, can be used.</p>

  <p>The physical basis for the methodology used is that point
  targets (i.e. SAR image resolution cells for which the scattering
  is dominated by a target which is small in size as compared to
  the size of the resolution cell) do not exhibit the speckle
  observed for extended targets. For a point target almost the same
  backscattering intensity is found when processing different looks
  with fractional azimuth and range bandwidth.</p>

  <p>sp_stat uses the Mean to Standard deviation Ratio (MSR) as the
  (inverse) measure of the spectral variability. Lower spectral
  variability corresponds to higher MSR values. 1.2 might be a
  possible threshold to use.</p>

  <p>As an additional (or alternative) criteria an SLC intensity
  above a minimum value can be indicated. As a simplification not
  an absolute value, but one relative to the spatial average is
  used. The idea behind this second criteria is to limit the points
  to dominating points (which need to be above the background
  level).</p>

  <p>An alternative measure for the spectral diversity is the
  spectral correlation which is calculated in sp_stat. This measure
  is high for a low diversity. Concsequently, values above a given
  threshold are point target candidates. One advantage of the
  correlation measure is that it is "well focussed", meanning that
  in the case of a point target a high values is typically only
  found for one pixel, while the other criteria tend to be met also
  by some adjecent pixels.</p>

  <p>In sp_stat the point list is determined from a single SLC.
  This means that no temporal criteria are considered. So the
  criteria used is clearly not temporal stability, but the point
  target characteristics expected in a single image.</p>

  <p>To combine the functionality of sp_stat with multi-temporal
  criteria point lists sp_stat can be used to generated point lists
  for multiple co-registered SLC and then to combine these into a
  single list using the program merge_pt.</p>

  <p>Advantages of sp_stat are that it can also be used in the case
  of a small serie of SLC (or even with a single SLC). Furthermore,
  it is less critical than pwr_stat, what concerns the radiometric
  calibration. On the other hand the SLC used should be well
  focussed.</p>

  <p>A clear disadvantage of sp_stat is that the temporal stability
  criteria is not used. For an interferometric analysis of point
  targets it is essential that the point targets remain visible,
  which is only the case for a fraction of the point targets. A
  car, for example, may be identified as a point target, but it may
  not be present at the same location in a second SLC.</p>

  <p>For large series of co-registered SLC pwr_stat is the
  preferred program to point lists. For small series sp_stat
  combined with a temporal consistancy element coming from the
  merging of several point lists using merge_pt is preferred.</p>

  <p>Instead of the full area of the SLC a sub-section can be
  selected.</p>

  <p>If the SLC has been oversampled in range, then the integer
  range over-sampling factor must be specified on the command line
  using the r_ovr parameter.</p>

  <p>Other programs to generate new point lists are image2pt,
  mkgrid, merge_pt, prox_pt, and sp_stat.</p>

  <p>Programs to validate existing point lists are qc_pt and
  expand_pt.</p>
