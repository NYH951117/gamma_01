  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>radcal_pwr_stat SLC_tab SLC_tab_cal - 1.5 1.0 - - - -
  plist_cal</samp></p>

  <p>Performs relative calibration of the SLCs listed in SLC_tab
  and writes the calibrated output to the SLCs listed in
  SLC_tab_cal. The data are used to determine points with low
  temporal variablity.&nbsp; These points are then used to
  determine relative calibration scale factors for the SLC images.
  The coordinates of these points are written to the output point
  list plist_cal.<br></p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  radcal_pwr_stat detects points with low temporal variability in
  the image stack&nbsp; and uses these points to perform relative
  radiometric calibration. The assumption is that points with low
  temporal variablity are radiometrically stable and can be used
  for relative calibration. The temporal variability is measured by
  the ratio of the temporal mean to sigma ratio, where sigma is the
  standard deviation of the backscatter intensity.<br></p>

  <p>Alternately the user can provide a list of point coordinates
  using the plist parameter. An important condition for a
  successful use of radcal_pwr_stat is accurate co-registration of
  the SLCs.</p>

  <p>The sum of all the point intensities in the list is evaluated
  for each SLC at the point coordinates. The ratio of the SLC sum
  for the points&nbsp; to the average power at the points of all
  the layers is evaluated for each SLC to calculate a radiometric
  scale factor.&nbsp; The square root of this scale factor is then
  applied to the SLC real and imaginary components and the output
  is written to the&nbsp; SLC listed in the SLC_tab_cal.&nbsp;
  There must be the same number of entries in the SLC_tab_cal as in
  the SLC_tab.<br></p>

  <p>The physical basis for the methodology used is that point
  targets (i.e. SAR image resolution cells for which the scattering
  is dominated by a target which is small in size as compared to
  the size of the resolution cell) do not exhibit the speckle
  observed for extended targets. For a point target almost the same
  backscattering intensity is found when observing from slightly
  different directions. For an extended target the backscattering
  will strongly fluctuate if the change in direction corresponds to
  an offset of the order of the critical baseline known in
  interferometry. For point targets which remain unchanged over
  time it is expected that the temporal variability is small
  relative to the temporal average. For extended targets with a
  fully developped speckle behavior it is expected that the
  temporal variability is of the order of the temporal average.</p>

  <p>radcal_pwr_stat uses the Mean to Standard deviation Ratio
  (MSR) as the (inverse) measure of the temporal variability. For
  fully developed speckle the MSR should be 1.0. Lower temporal
  variability corresponds to higher MSR values, so that 1.5 is good
  place to start.&nbsp; As a second criteria for calibration point
  selection is given by the PWR_cal threshold that sets an minimum
  SLC intensity to accept a point as a candidate.&nbsp; For very
  small sets of SLC the intensity criteria may still be useful
  while the MSR criteria may get more unreliable due to poor
  statistics. To get reliable statistics with temporal variability
  a sufficient number of scenes is required with a minimum of about
  20.&nbsp;<br></p>

  <p>Instead of the full area of the SLC a sub-section can be
  selected using the roff, loff, nr, and nl command line
  parameters.</p>

  <p>It is also possible to use this program iteratively and it
  should cause the relative calibration factors to converge. To
  iterate the relative calibration use the calibrated output SLCs
  as the input data stack. Then determine a new set of points with
  low temporal variablity. There should be more points than
  initially were found because the scenes are hopefully better
  radiometrically calibrated. The calibration factors determined by
  radcal_pwr_stat should should rapidly converge to 1.<br></p>

  <p>The calibration factor stored in the SLC parameter file is
  updated for the applied relative scaling.<br></p>

  <p>The file names of the co-registered SLC are provided in a text
  file (ascii) with each line containing one SLC file name in the
  first column and the SLC parameter file name in the second
  column. A possibility to generate this text file is to use a
  command <a href="../../DIFF/html/mk_tab.html">mk_tab</a>.</p>
