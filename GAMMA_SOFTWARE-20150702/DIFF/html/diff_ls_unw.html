  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <a href="diff_ls_unw.html">diff_ls_unw</a> reads two unwrapped
  interferometric phase images, estimating the phase of the first
  image by a evaluating a quadratic function of the phase in the
  second interferogram. The estimate is then subtracted from the
  phase of the first interferogram and stored in the result. The
  coefficients of the quadratic function are evaluated using a
  least squares fit in program <a href=
  "diff_ls_fit.html">diff_ls_fit</a> and stored in the DIFF
  parameter file.</p>

  <p>The first interferogram can be either complex valued or
  real-valued unwrapped phase. In the case where the input is
  complex valued, the differential interferogram will also be
  complex valued. The advantage of this is that there will be no
  unwrapping errors in the result, nor will any areas be excluded.
  No unwrapping will be required of the result if the phase
  signature has a magnitude less than PI. The user has the option
  of conjugating the output phase. This is useful if the
  interferogram is made in time reversed order, i.e. the reference
  SLC is acquired after the second SLC used to make the
  interferogram. In this way all the differential phase shifts have
  the same relationship with respect to motion towards or away the
  radar.</p>

  <p>It is preferred that the baseline of the second interferogram
  is sufficiently large. Using the phase of an interferogram with a
  very short baseline as a reference for the topographic phase
  usually leads to poor results because of the up-scaling of
  non-topographic phase components. Be sure to use the same
  interferograms that were used to estimate the coefficients of the
  quadratic function and stored in the DIFF parameter file.</p>

  <p><a href="diff_ls_unw.html">diff_ls_unw</a> requires that
  interferograms have the original phase trend and therefore are
  not flattened. The program ph_slope_base may be used to add back
  the phase trend removed when flattening the interferogram using
  an ellipsoidal Earth model. <a href=
  "diff_ls_unw.html">diff_ls_unw</a> may be used for 2-pass,
  3-pass, and 4-pass differential interferometry.</p>
