  <br>
  A linear regression of the unwrapped phase is performed. The
  linear deformation phase rate is stored in the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">prate</span>, the intercept at the start of
  the phase is stored in <span style=

  <br>
  The SLC reference parameter file is required to determine the
  derivative of phase with respect to height if height corrections
  are being estimated.

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  This program addresses the problem where you want to solve for
  the time-series of the deformation phase given a set of
  multi-reference unwrapped deformation phases. The input set of
  deformation phases are typically over specified such that more
  than one interferogram contains information from each of the SLCs
  in the input data set and that the observations can be linked
  together. Implicit is the idea that the total deformation phase
  at time <span style="font-style: italic;">t<sub>2</sub></span> is
  the sum of deformations from <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">t<sub>0</sub></span> to <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">t<sub>1</sub></span> and from <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">t<sub>1</sub></span> to <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">t<sub>2</sub></span>. &nbsp;Therefore the
  total deformation phase at some time&nbsp; time <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">t<sub>n</sub></span> can be expressed as a
  linear combination of &nbsp;measurements in the input data if tn
  is &nbsp;exists in the set of input deformation phases and the
  the set of measurements is <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">connected.</span></p>

  <p>The program <span style="font-style: italic;">mb_pt</span>
  generates a times-series of unwrapped deformation phase given a
  multi-temporal reference stack of unwrapped phases. The
  deformation phase data are derived from pairs of SLC images
  covering the time intervals of interest.&nbsp; <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">mb_pt</span> estimates the deformation
  phase time-series&nbsp;using a weighted least-squares algorithm
  that minimizes the sum of squared weighted residual phases. The
  residuals are the differences between input&nbsp; phases (the
  observations) and the differential phases derived from the
  time-series solution. Smoothing of the time series solution is
  acheived by introduction of constraints on the change in velocity
  as described by Schmidt and Burgmann (Journal of Geophysical
  Research,&nbsp; VOL. 108, NO. B9, 2416, doi:10.1029/2002JB002267,
  2003). Higher values of gamma lead to smoother solutions. Values
  of gamma =1 are moderately smoothed, while gamma=100 leads to an
  essentially linear deformation curve.<br></p>

  <p>We also include estimation of a DEM height correction
  parameter (hgt_flg=1). The phase model includes a height related
  term proportional to the derivative of the interferometric phase
  with respect to height. This additional degree of freedom permits
  calculation of a height correction for all the interferograms
  that minimizes the phase residuals in a least-squares sense. If
  the value of the smoothing parameter is set to 0, then the value
  of the height correction will be very close to 0.0 since the
  phase can then be fully attributed to motion of the surface or
  atmosphere. Only when the smoothing parameter is &gt; 0 can
  height corrections be calculated.&nbsp; The height corrections
  are consistant over a range of values of the smoothing parameter
  gamma &gt; 0.5.</p>

  <p>Input to <span style="font-style: italic;">mb_pt</span> is the
  multi-reference <span style="font-style: italic;">itab</span>
  file that provides information on the pairs of SLCs used to
  create each of the interferogram layers in the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">diff_in</span> stack. Also input is the
  stack of SLC parameters for the images referenced in the
  <span style="font-style: italic;">itab</span>, and the
  corresponding unwrapped deformation phases <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">diff_in</span>. Typically the input
  deformation phases are from differential&nbsp;interferograms with
  the topographic and residual orbital phases removed.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>An&nbsp; example of a multi-reference <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">itab</span> is:</p>

  <p><code>1&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 1<br>
  1&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 1<br>
  1&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 1<br>
  3&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 1<br>
  4&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 1<br>
  4&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 1<br>
  5&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 1<br>
  5&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp; 1<br>
  6&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp; 1<br>
  6&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp; 1<br>
  6&nbsp; 11&nbsp;&nbsp; 11&nbsp; 1<br>
  &nbsp; ...<br>
  22&nbsp; 25&nbsp;&nbsp; 35&nbsp; 1<br>
  22&nbsp; 27&nbsp;&nbsp; 36&nbsp; 1<br>
  23&nbsp; 27&nbsp;&nbsp; 37&nbsp; 1<br>
  24&nbsp; 27&nbsp;&nbsp; 38&nbsp; 1<br>
  25&nbsp; 27&nbsp;&nbsp; 39&nbsp; 1<br>
  25&nbsp; 28&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp; 1</code></p>

  <p>The entries in the multi-reference <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">itab</span> were selected such that
  they&nbsp;satisfy specific criteria with respect to perpendicular
  baseline and time interval. The program&nbsp; <a href=
  "base_calc.html">base_calc</a>, can be used to construct the
  multi-reference <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">&nbsp;itab</span> with entries that fulfill
  baseline, and time interval criteria. Note that the minimum time
  interval should be set to 1 day to avoid having
  auto-interferograms that contain no phase information.<br></p>

  <p>Gaps in interferometric times series occur if there is no
  interferogram connecting different dates in the input data
  set.&nbsp; In &nbsp;a connected set of observations it is
  possible to synthesize an interferogram for any set of dates
  covered by the input measurements by taking a linear combination
  of the existing interferograms. If this is not possible then the
  network is not fully connected. The gap can be interpolated under
  the assumption that the phase rate does not change
  discontinously. Setting the smoothing parameter gamma &gt;
  0&nbsp; adds a cost associated with a change in the deformation
  rate.&nbsp; The least-squares minimization will then interpolate
  across the gap.&nbsp; If no smoothing is performed, then the
  deformation rate will be 0 across the gap and lead to errors in
  the total deformation.<br></p>

  <p>An example of an input <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">itab</span> with a temporal gap would
  be:</p>

  <p><code>1&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 1<br>
  1&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 1<br>
  4&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 1<br>
  4 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 1</code></p>

  <p>As can be seen by inspection&nbsp; there is no interferometric
  phase information covering the period between the times when
  SLC-3 and SLC-4 were acquired. There is no connection between the
  interferometric data for acquisitions {1, 2, 3} and acquisitions
  {4, 5, 6} and hence there is no change in the output&nbsp; time
  series phase during the time interval from SLC-3 to SLC-4. When
  the smoothing of the time series is performed then the gap
  interpolated with a function that minimizes the change in
  deformation rate before and after the gap.<br></p>

  <p>The output deformation phase time-series is calculated at each
  acquisition time of SLCs used to create the input interferogram
  stack. The solution is only available for times covered in the
  input interferogram data set.&nbsp;The phase time-series values
  are obtained by summing up the phase contribution for each time
  interval from the start of the series. In the example, the output
  single reference <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">itab_out</span> has entries:</p>

  <p><code>1&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 &nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 1<br>
  1&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 1<br>
  1&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 1<br>
  1&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 1<br>
  ...<br>
  1&nbsp; 27 &nbsp;&nbsp; 23&nbsp; 1<br>
  1&nbsp;&nbsp;28 &nbsp;&nbsp; 24&nbsp; 1</code></p>

  <p>Note that each differential interferogram in the output is
  referenced to the time of the earliest scene in the
  series.&nbsp;By definition, the deformation is set to 0 at the
  initial epoch for the series. If phase values are desired for
  other times, then these can be obtained by interpolation using
  the program <a href="t_interp_pt.html">t_interp_pt</a>. The phase
  series values can be converted to deformation along the line of
  sight (LOS) using the program <a href=
  "dispmap_pt.html">dispmap_pt</a>.</p>

  <p>The program <span style="font-style: italic;">mb_pt</span>
  uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (see&nbsp; <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition</a>
  ) to obtain the least-squares solution for the phase time-series.
  As part of the screen output <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">mb_pt</span> generates a list of the
  singular values of the design matrix constructed from the
  <span style="font-style: italic;">itab</span> and observation
  times. The design matrix contains the coefficients of the set of
  linear equations that express the relationships between the
  observed phase data and the desired times series values. The
  number of singular values is equal to the number of&nbsp; times
  in the output time series. If a value is less than the largest
  singular value/1.e5, the value is set to 0. A singular value
  indicates that the constraints in the design matrix are
  insufficient to fully define the output time series. Setting the
  singular value to zero forces the time-series output &nbsp;to
  remain constant over the unconstrained gap in the input
  observations.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">mb_pt</span> also calculates
  the set of simulated deformation phase for each of the input
  interferograms&nbsp; using&nbsp; the estimated deformation
  phase-time series. Subtracting the simulated deformation phase
  from the input interferogram leaves a combination of&nbsp;
  residual baseline phase, noise, and phase unwrapping errors. This
  suggests the use of <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">mb_pt</span>&nbsp; for iterative
  improvement of the processing results. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Redundancy in the the differential interferogram input data
  reduces errors in the time-series due to phase errors due to
  baseline, topographic phase correction, and interferometric
  decorrelation. The effect of atmospheric phase on the other hand
  is not reduced by this estimation procedure. The reason for this
  is that the atmospheric phase cannot be distinguished from random
  deformation since it is directly related to path delay. The
  smoothing parameter gamma introduces an additional cost related
  to rapid changes in the phase. This permits independent
  estimation of a height correction for each point.<br></p>

  <p>Individual interferogram layers in the input stack can be
  switched on and off using the&nbsp;<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">switch_flag</span> value (last column) in
  the input itab. Setting the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">switch_flag</span> to 0 removes that
  particular layer from the solution. Note that if a particular
  acquisition occurs only in this layer, then it will not appear in
  the solution. Also realize that removing a particular
  interferogram has a good chance of destroying the connectivity of
  the input interferogram network causing a gap in the output&nbsp;
  time-series. However even if the the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">switch_flag</span> is set to 0 for a
  particular layer, the deformation phase for that layer is
  simulated when possible. The simulated phase can then be
  subtracted from the input interferogram and help with unwrapping
  that layer. &nbsp;If the unwrapped phase for a single point is
  0.0 in a layer&nbsp; that is turned on (<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">switch_flag</span> = 1), then no
  time-series solution is generated for that point.</p>

  <p>The output stack <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">psigma_out</span> contains an estimate of
  the standard deviation of time series phase values obtained from
  the residuals simulated phases <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">pdiff_out</span> and the input observations
  <span style="font-style: italic;">pdiff_in</span>. For each point
  sigma is evaluated over the number of layers in the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">diff_in</span> stack Contributions to the
  standard deviation include interferometric decorrelation,
  residual baseline error, and possibly phase unwrapping
  errors.<br></p>

  <p>It is also possible to perform a linear regression of the the
  time-series phase. The slope of the linear regression is stored
  in the the <span style="font-style: italic;">prate</span> file,
  the phase constant at relative time t=0 is stored in <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">pconst</span>, and the standard deviation
  of the phase relative to the linear fit in <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">psigma_fit</span>.<br></p>
