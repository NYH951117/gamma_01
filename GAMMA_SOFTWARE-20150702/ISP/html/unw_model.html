  <p><b>EXAMPLE</b><br>
  <tt>unw_model 01608_02109.flt 01608_02109.unw_model
  01608_02109.unw 2456 800 400 0.0</tt></p>

  <p>Unwraps the complex valued interferogram assuming that the
  unwrapped phase is within the interval (-PI,PI) of the provided
  model. After completion of the unwrapping a phase constant is
  subtracted from all unwrapped phase values such that the
  unwrapped phase at the indicated reference location (800,400)
  will corresponds to the indicated reference phase value (0.0 in
  the above example).</p>

  <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
  <i>unw_model</i> unwraps a complex-valued interferogram using a
  pre-existing unwrapped phase model. For each pixel the unwrapped
  phase value is set to the value which is within the interval
  (-PI,PI) of the provided model and which is consistant with the
  complex valued interferogram in the sense that re-wrapping of the
  unwrapped interferogram will result in the original interferogram
  phase value, except for a constant phase offset, originating from
  setting the unwrapped phase at a reference location to a
  reference value.</p>

  <p>The pre-requisite for the model used is that it deviates from
  the true unwrapped phase by only a small value. For deviations
  larger than PI the unwrapped phase will be set on the wrong
  ambiguity, i.e. it will deviate from the correct unwrapping by a
  multiple of 2*PI.</p>

  <p>Unwrapped phase models can be obtained in different ways:</p>

  <p>a) From modeling of the different terms (topographic,
  deformation, path delay term) of the interferometric phase. It
  has to be kept in mind, though, that the uncertainty in the path
  delay or atmospheric distortion term can easily be outside the
  tolerable interval.</p>

  <p>b) By scaling of an independent unwarpped interferogram as
  done in multi-pass differential interferometry. Again, the
  uncertainty in the path delay or atmospheric distortion term can
  be outside the tolerable interval.</p>

  <p>c) By an unwrapping result which was obtained using
  multi-looking followed by interpolation of the unwrapped result
  to the original resoltion.</p>

  <p>d) By an unwrapping result which was obtained using adaptive
  sampling reduction followed by interpolation of the unwrapped
  result to the original (full) sampling.</p>

  <p>After completion of the model based unwrapping a phase
  constant can be subtracted from all unwrapped phase values such
  that the unwrapped phase at the indicated reference location
  (800,400) will corresponds to the indicated reference phase value
  (0.0 in the above example). This can be used, for example, in
  differential interferoemtry to set the deformation phase of a
  stable reference location to 0.0.</p>

  <p><b>OPTIONS</b><br>
  The user can specify independently the line width of the model
  phase file. The need for this arises if <a href=
  "multi_cpx.html">&nbsp;multi_cpx</a> and <a href=
  "multi_real.html">multi_real</a> have been used to unwrap a
  multi-looked version of the interferogram. When working with full
  frame inteferograms &nbsp;a vialble approach is to unwrap as
  asingle patch, &nbsp;a multi-looked &nbsp;version of the
  interferogram. This smaller interferogram is then reexpanded with
  multi_real&nbsp; and&nbsp; used as a phase model. The expanded
  phase model may have a slightly different line width because the
  original interferogram line width is not a multiple of the
  scaling factor that was used.&nbsp;</p>
