  <p>Simulates an unwrapped phase image for the specific geometry
  of an interferometric pair using a height map in the geometry of
  the interferogram. The interferometric phase is simulated for
  repeat-pass interferometry (int_mode = 1).</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">phase_sim_orb</span> simulates
  an interferogram based on a height map and a deformation rate
  map, both in SAR range-Doppler coordinates (RDC). The baseline
  for each point is calculated using the DEM height, slant range,
  doppler centroid, and state vectors. This approach is applicable
  for long image strips where the linear baseline model may be
  inadequate and residual quadratic phase trends may still be
  visible. In the case of interferograms all generated using the
  same reference image, use the parameter file of the reference
  image as the SLC1_par argument.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The height map in SAR geometry is obtained by resampling a
  digital elevation model (DEM) into SAR coordinates. The geometric
  transformation is determined by simulation of a SAR intensity
  image (in SAR geometry) from the DEM. The simulated SAR intensity
  image is then registered to a real SAR intensity image using a
  cross correlation registration approach for real valued data.
  This step is required to remove errors resulting from small
  errors in the orbit geometry. If a - is entered for the height
  file, then all heights are set to 0.0.</p>

  <p>Simulated interferometric phase is used primarily for
  generating 2-pass differential interferograms. In 2-pass
  differential interferometry the phase corresponding to the
  terrain topography is simulated and subtracted from an
  interferometric pair which contains both differential and
  topographic phase components.To calculate the deformation phase
  term the user must provide the LOS deformation rate and the
  number days between images used to calculate the specific
  interferogram pair.<br></p>

  <p>The interferometric mode (<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">int_mode)</span> option permits selection
  of either single or repeat pass mode. The single pass
  interferometric phase is half as large as the repeat pass
  simulated phase because the path difference is half that compared
  to repeat pass interferometry.&nbsp; Tandem-X data are acquired
  in single-pass mode where one satellite transmits and the other
  receives. In this case <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">int_mode</span> must be set to 0 to
  correctly simulate the interferometric phase.<br></p>

  <p>The process for calculation of a deformation rate map can be
  as follows. First obtain an initial differential interferogram
  using a DEM and state vectors. Unwrap this differential initial
  interferogram. In general this interferogram will have some
  residual phase trend. Next use <i>base_ls (from the ISP)</i> to
  estimate a residual baseline using the height map in SAR geometry
  and the unwrapped phase. The effective baseline for the residual
  phase should be relatively small and the linear model used by
  <i>base_ls</i> and <i>phase_sim</i> should be adequate. Add the
  two simulated interferograms together to get the net simulated
  interferogram using <a href="sub_phase.html">sub_phase</a>.
  Subtract this net simulated phase from the original
  interferometric phase using <a href=
  "sub_phase.html">sub_phase</a> or generate the differential
  interferogram directly from the resampled SLC data using <a href=
  "SLC_diff_intf.html">SLC_diff_intf.html</a>. Filter and unwrap
  the differential interferogram. Then scale the unwrapped phase
  using <a href="dispmap.html">dispmap</a> to obtain the LOS
  deformation rate.</p>

  <p>Note that the the residual phase is the combination of
  residual baseline error, deformation, and tropospheric phase.
  Therefore it is important to select a time interval for the
  interferogram that is sufficiently long that the deformation
  phase dominates over baseline error and tropospheric phase.</p>

  <p>The user has the option to specify the SLC parameter file of
  the SLC used as the geometric reference for a stack of images. If
  the geometric reference of the interferometric pair is other than
  SLC1, it is recommended to specify the parameter file for the
  geometric reference SLC. This reduces errors due to shifts in
  timing and sampling introduced by the resampling of SLC1 and SLC2
  into the geometry of the reference SLC.</p>

  <p>There is also the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">ph_mode</span> command line option to
  subtract a multiple of 2PI from the simulated interferogram to
  improve the accuracy of the single-precision phase data stored in
  the output file. When there is a large difference in slant range,
  the magnitude of the interferometric phase can become large
  enough (~200000) such that there is a a measurable loss of
  accuracy in the phase data due to the single-precision
  representation.&nbsp; The value of the phase that is subtracted
  from the entire simulated interferogram is calculated from the
  simulated phase at the center of the interferogram with a height
  of 0.0. This phase value is then rounded to the nearest multiple
  of 2PI. All internal calculations related to the phase that are
  internal to the program are performed using double-precision.</p>
