  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>
  <samp>pwr_stat testsite.SLC_tab - testsite.plist 1.5 1.0 - - - -
  1 1</samp></p>

  <p>Generates a point list of coordinates of points with a low
  temporal variability of the SLC intensity and an intensity above
  the spatial average.</p>

  <p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong><br>
  Source code pwr_stat.c in ./IPTA/src, executable version pwr_stat
  in ./IPTA/bin</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  In the IPTA point lists contain the coordinates (range and
  azimuth pixel number relative to the reference SLC geometry) of
  the selected points. Data at these points (SLC values,
  interferogram values, ...) are stored in point data stacks with
  each record corresponding to a different SLC or interferogram.
  The point data stack of mask values contains for each point a
  flag (0 or 1) which indicates if the data of a point are
  considered (1) or not considered (0).</p>

  <p>pwr_stat supports the generation of point lists of "point
  target candidates". pwr_stat identifies "point target candidates"
  based on a low temporal variability of the SLC intensity (i.e. a
  mean to temporal standard deviation ration above the indicated
  threshold) and an SLC intensity above an incidated threshold
  relative to the spatial average.</p>

  <p>The physical basis for the methodology used is that point
  targets (i.e. SAR image resolution cells for which the scattering
  is dominated by a target which is small in size as compared to
  the size of the resolution cell) do not exhibit the speckle
  observed for extended targets. For a point target almost the same
  backscattering intensity is found when observing from slightly
  different directions. For an extended target the backscattering
  will strongly fluctuate if the change in direction corresponds to
  an offset of the order of the critical baseline known in
  interferometry. For point targets which remain unchanged over
  time it is expected that the temporal variability is small
  relative to the temporal average. For extended targets with a
  fully developped speckle behavior it is expected that the
  temporal variability is of the order of the temporal average.</p>

  <p>pwr_stat uses the Mean to Standard deviation Ratio (MSR) as
  the (inverse) measure of the temporal variability. For fully
  developed speckle the MSR should be 1.0. Lower temporal
  variability corresponds to higher MSR values, so that 1.5
  reasonable initial threshold to use.</p>

  <p>As a second (or alternative) criteria an SLC intensity above
  minimum value can be indicated. As a simplification not an
  absolute value, but one relative to the spatial average is used.
  The idea behind this second criteria is to limit the points to
  dominating points (which need to be above the background level).
  For very small sets of SLC the intensity criteria may still be
  useful while the MSR criteria may get more unreliable due to poor
  statistics.</p>

  <p>To get reliable statistics on the temporal variability it is a
  suficient number of scenes is required. With fewer than 20 scenes
  this criteria tends to become less reliable. In any case a 100%
  reliability cannot be expected, so that a subsequent control of
  the usefullness of the identified points remains necessary. On
  the other hand this methodology may also fail to detect useful
  points.</p>

  <p>Important conditions for a successful use of pwr_stat are the
  accurate co-registration of the SLC and a good relative
  radiometric calibration. There are 3 options for relative
  radiometric calibration by the [mode] parameter.&nbsp; Mode 0
  applies no relative calibration scaling between scenes and
  assumes that the relative calibration of the sensor<br>
  is adequate. Mode 1 uses the average scene intensity to derive
  normalization factors, and can be used for areas with small
  temporal variation in backscatter (desert or urban areas).
  Finally Mode 2 (default)&nbsp; identifies a number of point
  targets given the initial relative calibration. Because most of
  these points are point targets, they are assumed to have constant
  temporal backscatter and can be used for relative calibration
  between scenes.<br></p>

  <p>To generate a point list which shall be used for an initial
  analysis it is recommended to set the MSR and intensity
  thresholds to relatively high values which will result in a
  relatively short list, but with a high fraction of "good points",
  i.e. points for which interferometric interpretation of the
  phases is possible.</p>

  <p>To generate a candidate point list which shall be used to
  determine the final "long list" it is recommended to set the MSR
  threshold to a relatively low value and the intensity threshold
  to a value smaller than 1. (or even 0.0 to ignor this second
  criteria entireley). This will result in a long short list, but
  with a much lower fraction of "good points". But more important
  at this stage is that only very few "good points" are lost.</p>

  <p>Instead of the full area of the SLC a sub-section can be
  selected using the roff, loff, nr, and nl command line
  parameters.</p>

  <p>The file names of the co-registered SLC are provided in a text
  file (ascii) with each line containing one SLC file name. A
  possibility to generate this text file is to use a command such
  as: <samp>ls -1 *.rslc &gt; testsite.SLC_tab</samp>.</p>

  <p>Other programs to generate new point lists are image2pt,
  mkgrid, merge_pt, prox_pt, and sp_stat.</p>

  <p>Programs to validate existing point lists are qc_pt and
  expand_pt.</p>
