  <p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong><br clear="all">

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br clear="all">
  The Doppler centroid is a necessary parameter for SAR processing.
  Due to the fact that the radar is a sampled data system, i.e. the
  SAR acquires echoes at the rate of the pulse repetition frequency
  (PRF), the Doppler spectrum is aliased modulo the PRF. This means
  that some other method must be used to determine an unambiguous
  value of the Doppler centroid apart from simple fourier analysis
  of the azimuth spectrum. A very effective method is to measure
  the range migration rate of targets in the scene. This can be
  combined with the auto-focus that determines the effective value
  of the along-track velocity for precise focus. If the correct
  Doppler ambiguity has been be selected, then the cross
  correlation between images formed from different segments of the
  Doppler spectrum will be aligned in slant range.</p>

  <p>The raw SAR data (IQ complex data)can be used to estimate the
  ambiguity number of the Doppler centroid using the methods
  described by Wong and Cumming (A Combined SAR Doppler Centroid
  Estimation Scheme based upon Signal Phase, <em>IEEE Trans.
  Geosci. Remote Sensing</em>, Vol. 34, No. 3, May 1996, pp.
  696-707.) The signal phase from different complex range looks is
  used to obtain an unambiguous estimate of the Doppler centroid.
  This value is stored in the Processing Parameter file in the
  DAR_doppler structure member. The programs <a href=
  "doppler.html">doppler</a> and <a href="azsp_IQ.html">azsp_IQ</a>
  can use the unambiguous Doppler estimate to determine the Doppler
  ambiguity number and add it to the accurate, but ambiguous
  estimate.</p>

  <p>Two algorithm are available to obtain unambiguous Doppler
  estimates. The Multi-Look Cross Correlation (MLCC) algorithm
  measures the difference in Doppler centroid as a function of
  frequency. The correlation method of centroid estimation is
  implemented as in <a href="doppler.html">doppler</a> for two
  segments of the range spectrum. The rate of change of Doppler
  with respect to frequency yields an unambiguous estimate of the
  Doppler centroid. The second algorithm (Multi-Look Beat
  Frequency) or MLBF is the most robust for most applications looks
  at the cross spectrum between range looks and depends on coherent
  point targets to be effective. See discussion in the <a href=
  "MSP_users_guide.html">Users Guide</a>. The data segment used for
  the estimation can be specified by the user by setting the offset
  in lines relative to the beginning of the file.</p>

  <p>The MLCC plots the Doppler in radians of phase shift between
  range lines versus the slant range pixel. If the average of the
  correlation coefficient between range pulses is PI/2, then the
  centroid is PRF/2 + N*PRF where N is the number of ambiguities in
  the Doppler centroid. The phase of the correlation is plotted for
  both the upper and lower segments of the range bandwidth. The
  last column is the difference between the Doppler centroid
  estimates of the upper and lower band range bandwidth. This
  difference can be used to determine a noisy estimate of the
  unambiguous Doppler centroid. The avarage value of the difference
  is used to determine the unambiguous estimate of the Doppler
  centroid. The program <a href="dop_mlcc.html">dop_mlcc</a> can be
  used to process an entire file.</p>
