  <p>Determines a co-registration azimuth offset refinement based
  on the sub-swath overlap regions, applying a "spectral diversity
  method". The updated azimuth offset refinement is written out to
  the output offset parameter file (20141003_20141015.off_out).</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em> is used in the S1 IWS
  co-registration procedure or to assess the co-registration
  quality of co-registered S1 IWS SLCs.</p>

  <p>As input a pair (master and slave) of two already almost
  perfectly co-registered Sentinel-1 (S1) Interferometric Wide
  Swath (IWS) burst SLC are provided. These burst SLCs consist of
  the sub-swath burst SLCs for at least two sub-swaths (with only
  one sub-swath there is not sub-swath overlap region!) as defined
  in the SLC_tabs provided for the reference (e.g.
  20141003.SLC_tab) and the slave (20141015.RSLC_tab). For each
  sub-swath the SLC_tab contains one line with the burst SLC name
  (e.g 20141015.IW1.rslc), the name of the SLC parameter file of
  the burst SLC (e.g 20141015.IW1.rslc.par), and the related TOPS
  parameter file (e.g. 20141015.IW1.rslc.TOPS_par). In this IW1 is
  used to indicate that it is for the first sub-swath (IW1) and
  rslc is used to express that it is an already co-registered slave
  burst SLC.</p>

  <p>The indicated pair parameter (e.g. 20141003_20141015) is used
  in the naming of the intermediate files automatically generated
  by the program.</p>

  <p>Then an input and an output offset parameter file need to be
  indicated. The input offset parameter file is the file that was
  used in the co-registration of the burst SLC pair (as used when
  resampling the slave burst SLC using the program
  SLC_interp_S1_TOPS). The input offset parameter file can already
  contain offset polynomials e.g. as determined in a refinement
  using intensity matching or in a previous iteration using
  S1_coreg_subswath_overlap. The output offset parameter file
  corresponds to a copy of the input offset parameter file with an
  update to the constant value of the azimuth offset
  polynomial.</p>

  <p>To apply the refined azimuth offset refinement you need to
  rerun the slave burst SLC resampling, but using the output offset
  parameter file instead of the input offset parameter file (when
  running the the program SLC_interp_S1_TOPS).</p>

  <p><em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em> applies a spectral
  diversity method to all the subswath overlap regions between an
  earlier burst of the sub-swath with the lower number and the
  later overlapping burst of the sub-swath with the higher number
  (e.g. the start times for the IW1 bursts are earlier than the
  start time of the considered overlapping IW2 bursts). In this way
  the overlap in along track direction is about 2/3 of the burst
  length and the time offset between the start times (and
  accordingly the sensitivity of the phase to azimuth
  misregistration) is about 1/3 of the one for the burst overlap
  region within a single sub-swath. For this it determines for each
  subswath overlap region which sections of the two sub-swaths and
  bursts are overlapping. For each overlap region these two
  sections are copied out of both the master and slave burst SLC,
  resulting in four small SLC sections of identical size. Single
  look interferograms are then calculated for the pair of SLC
  sections (master and slave) of the subswath with the lower
  number, and for the pair of SLC sections (master and slave) with
  the higher sub-swath number. Next the phase difference between
  these two single look interferograms is calculated to get the
  "double-difference" interferogram. This complex valued
  interferogram is then multi-looked and unwrapped. Before the
  unwrapping a coherence measure is calculated and used as
  weighting function in the minimum-cost-flow unwrapping (mcf) and
  to be used for the thresholding of potentially unreliable low
  coherence areas.</p>

  <p>For each overlap region an average unwrapped double-difference
  phase is calcualted. Only values with coherence values above the
  incidated coherence threshold are considered. Besides the average
  phase the program also calculates the phase standard deviation as
  an additional quality measure. Except for phase noise and phase
  caused by azimuth displacement a constant phase is expected. A
  significantly increased phase standard deviation is therefore a
  clear indication for the presence of unwrapping errors (which may
  occur considering that the high coherence areas may be spatially
  separated). Our experience shows that low phase standard
  deviation values (e.g. &lt; 0.8 radian) are a quite reliable
  indication for a reliable average unwrapped double difference
  phase.</p>

  <p>Besides the coherence and the phase standard deviation the
  program also consideres the fraction of the available non-zero
  pixels of the overlap region that was successully unwrapped. If
  this area is too small (e.g. smaller than a few percent) for a
  given overlap region then the average phase estimated for this
  overlap region is not further considered.</p>

  <p>Such average double difference phases are estimated for each
  sub-swath overlap region available (e.g. for each burst and the
  overlaps between IW1-IW2 and IW2-IW3, so with 9 bursts per
  sub-wath resulting in 18 overlap regions). The averages for the
  individual overlap regions are then averaged using the a
  weighting factor calculated based on the validity fraction and
  the phase standard deviation.</p>

  <p>This "global" phase offset between the earlier and later burst
  interferograms is then converted to an azimuth offset correction,
  considering the azimuth phase ramp present in the TOPS mode
  data.</p>

  <p>The determined azimuth offset correction, is used to update
  the constant value of the azimuth offset polynomial (taken from
  the input offset parameter file and written after updating to the
  output offset parameter file.</p>

  <p>Besides the updating of the azimuth offset polynomial the
  program provides a wealth of quality information on the
  estimation process, including coherence and phase statistics.</p>

  <p><em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em> generates a large amount of
  intermediate files, including interferograms, coherence maps,
  coherence masks, unwrapped phases, etc. for every available burst
  overlap regions. Normally, these many intermediate files are
  directly deleted at the end of the program without looking at it
  in detail. In cases where the co-registration refinement result
  does not converge or where the quality number give indications of
  problems it is recommended not to deleted the intermediate files
  and check them carefully to be able to optimize the tresholds
  used. Deleting or not deleting the intermediate files is done by
  setting the cleaning flag to 1 (which is the default and which
  means the files are deleted) or to 0 to keep the intermediate
  files.</p>

  <p>The factor for the scaling of the double difference phase
  offset determined to an azimuth offset in SLC pixels is around
  -0.048 azimuth SLC pixel per radian. This sensitivity also means
  that there can be a phase ambiguity problem for higher azimuth
  co-registration errors. A double difference interferometric phase
  of a full phase cycle (2PI) is reached for an azimuth
  co-registration error close to 0.3 azimuth SLC pixel.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br></p>

  <p>Using <em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em> to refine the
  co-registration for a slave acquired with a long temporal
  separation from the master scene may result in generally reduced
  coherence. As a way to optimize the coherence it is possible to
  indicate in addition to the master burst SLC a second already
  co-registered SLC (possibly one close in time to the slave
  considered). The program uses then this second scene to calculate
  the double-difference interfergrams, while the master geometry is
  the one of the true master.</p>

  <p>In cases where <em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em> does not
  succeed in estimating a reliable azimuth offset refinement it may
  be necessary to start from already better co-registered burst
  SLCs. An initial quality of around 0.03 azimuth pixel should be
  achieved before running <em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em>. Ways
  to achive this accuracy are matching techniques. As an
  alternative you may also try to use the program <a href=
  "S1_coreg_overlap.html">S1_coreg_overlap</a> nevertheless, you
  have to be aware that its sensitivity is higher and so if a too
  high azimuth misregistration is the problem then it is not likely
  that this can be resolved.</p>

  <p><em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em> can also be used to
  estimate offsets between sub-swaths that are not related to
  mis-registration effects. In pairs including a scene before about
  10-Mar-2015 and one after this date we found cases where we
  noticed a phase offset between IW1 and IW2, while there were no
  phase jumps between subsequent burst observed. We concluded that
  an phase offset occurred to the IW1 burst SLC phase. We could use
  <em>S1_coreg_subswath_overlap</em> to accurately estimate this
  offset that we used then to correct the IW1 SLC phase.</p>
