  <p>Reads the input phase unwrapping validity mask and reduces the
  sampling adaptively to the provided coherence. Five thinning runs
  are conducted.</p>

  <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
  <i>rascc_mask_thinning</i> Reads the input phase unwrapping
  validity mask and reduces the sampling adaptively to the provided
  coherence. In low coherence areas (i.e. for high phase noise or
  high phase gradient) the full sampling is maintained. In areas of
  higher coherence (i.e. for lower phase noise and lower phase
  gradients) the sampling is reduced.</p>

  <p>The main reason for such adaptive thinning of the phase
  unwrapping validity mask is to reduce the number of samples
  considered in the global optimization step of the Minimum Cost
  Flow (MCF) phase unwrapping technique. On one hand this technique
  is memory intensive, on the other hand gllobal optimization is
  wanted. In many cases masking and adaptive thinning of the
  validity mask allow to reduce the number of samples allowing to
  solve the MCF optimiation problem in a single step, i.e. without
  patching of the data, which is the necessary aproach
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The thinning is done in several runs. In a first run the
  sampling is reduced in areas where the reference file value,
  typically selected to be a coherence image, is above the first
  threshhold indicated. In a second run additional thinning is
  applied for areas where the reference file value is above the
  second threshhold indicated, and so on. Consequently, the
  threshold values indicated should rather increase, as larger
  scale thinning is only applicable for very low phase
  variation.</p>

  <p>The targeted thinning is that the phase variation between the
  retained points is small as compared to a full phase cycle.
  Undersampling has to be avoided, as this will increase the
  difficulty of the phase unwrapping.</p>

  <p>The input validity mask is generated using the program
  <a href="rascc_mask.html">rascc_mask</a> and it is used for phase
  unwrapping with the program <a href="mcf.html">mcf</a>, to avoid
  regions of high phase noise in the phase unwrapping.</p>

  <p>For all pixels corresponding to masked pixels (i.e. pixels not
  to be considered in the phase unwrapping) the validity mask
  values are set to 0, respectively to black, i.e. (0,0,0).</p>

  <p>The program <a href="interp_ad.html">interp_ad</a> can be used
  to interpolate the unwrapped phases with the reduced sampling. In
  order to have the full interferogram unwrapped these interpolate
  the unwrapped phases can be used as a model and assuming that the
  unwrapped phase value is always with an interval of (-PI,+PI) of
  the model value. This step is supported by the program <a href=
  "unw_model.html">unw_model</a> and permits to achieve an
  unwrapped phase fully corresponding to the wrapped phase in the
  sense that it is identical if re-wrapped.</p>
