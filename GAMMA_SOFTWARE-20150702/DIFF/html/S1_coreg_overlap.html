  <p>Determines a co-registration azimuth offset refinement based
  on the burst overlap regions, applying a "spectral diversity
  method". The updated azimuth offset refinement is written out to
  the output offset parameter file (20141003_20141015.off_out).</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>S1_coreg_overlap</em> is used in the S1 IWS co-registration
  procedure or to assess the co-registration quality of
  co-registered S1 IWS SLCs.</p>

  <p>As input a pair (master and slave) of two already almost
  perfectly co-registered Sentinel-1 (S1) Interferometric Wide
  Swath (IWS) burst SLC are provided. These burst SLCs consist of
  the sub-swath burst SLCs for one or several sub-swaths as defined
  in the SLC_tabs provided for the reference (e.g.
  20141003.SLC_tab) and the slave (20141015.RSLC_tab). For each
  sub-swath the SLC_tab contains one line with the burst SLC name
  (e.g 20141015.IW1.rslc), the name of the SLC parameter file of
  the burst SLC (e.g 20141015.IW1.rslc.par), and the related TOPS
  parameter file (e.g. 20141015.IW1.rslc.TOPS_par). In this IW1 is
  used to indicate that it is for the first sub-swath (IW1) and
  rslc is used to express that it is an already co-registered slave
  burst SLC.</p>

  <p>The indicated pair parameter (e.g. 20141003_20141015) is used
  in the naming of the intermediate files automatically generated
  by the program.</p>

  <p>Then an input and an output offset parameter file need to be
  indicated. The input offset parameter file is the file that was
  used in the co-registration of the burst SLC pair (as used when
  resampling the slave burst SLC using the program
  SLC_interp_S1_TOPS). The input offset parameter file can already
  contain offset polynomials e.g. as determined in a refinement
  using intensity matching or in a previous iteration using
  S1_coreg_overlap. The output offset parameter file corresponds to
  a copy of the input offset parameter file with an update to the
  constant value of the azimuth offset polynomial.</p>

  <p>To apply the refined azimuth offset refinement you need to
  rerun the slave burst SLC resampling, but using the output offset
  parameter file instead of the input offset parameter file (when
  running the the program SLC_interp_S1_TOPS).</p>

  <p><em>S1_coreg_overlap</em> applies a spectral diversity method
  to all the available burst overlap regions of all the available
  sub-swaths. For this it determines for each burst overlap regions
  which sections of the earlier and later burst are overlapping.
  For each overlap region these two sections are copied out of both
  the master and slave burst SLC, resulting in four small SLC
  sections of identical size. Single look interferograms are then
  calculated for the pair of SLC sections (master and slave) of the
  earlier burst, and for the pair of SLC sections (master and
  slave) of the later burst. Next the phase difference between
  these two single look interferograms is calculated to get the
  "double-difference" interferogram. This complex valued
  interferogram is then multi-looked and unwrapped. Before the
  unwrapping a coherence measure is calculated and used as
  weighting function in the minimum-cost-flow unwrapping (mcf) and
  to be used for the thresholding of potentially unreliable low
  coherence areas.</p>

  <p>For each burst overlap region an average unwrapped
  double-difference phase is calcualted. Only values with coherence
  values above the incidated coherence threshold are considered.
  Besides the average phase the program also calculates the phase
  standard deviation as an additional quality measure. Except for
  phase noise and phase caused by azimuth displacement a constant
  phase is expected. A significantly increased phase standard
  deviation is therefore a clear indication for the presence of
  unwrapping errors (which may occur considering that the high
  coherence areas may be spatially separated). Our experience shows
  that low phase standard deviation values (e.g. &lt; 0.8 radian)
  are a quite reliable indication for a reliable average unwrapped
  double difference phase.</p>

  <p>Besides the coherence and the phase standard deviation the
  program also consideres the fraction of the available non-zero
  pixels of the overlap region that was successully unwrapped. If
  this area is too small (e.g. smaller than a few percent) for a
  given overlap region then the average phase estimated for this
  overlap region is not further considered.</p>

  <p>Such average double difference phases are estimated for each
  burst overlap region available. The averages for the individual
  overlap regions are then averaged using the a weighting factor
  calculated based on the validity fraction and the phase standard
  deviation.</p>

  <p>This "global" phase offset between the earlier and later burst
  interferograms is then converted to an azimuth offset correction,
  considering the azimuth phase ramp present in the TOPS mode
  data.</p>

  <p>The determined azimuth offset correction, is used to update
  the constant value of the azimuth offset polynomial (taken from
  the input offset parameter file and written after updating to the
  output offset parameter file.</p>

  <p>Besides the updating of the azimuth offset polynomial the
  program provides a wealth of quality information on the
  estimation process, including coherence and phase statistics.</p>

  <p><em>S1_coreg_overlap</em> generates a large amount of
  intermediate files, including interferograms, coherence maps,
  coherence masks, unwrapped phases, etc. for every available burst
  overlap regions. Normally, these many intermediate files are
  directly deleted at the end of the program without looking at it
  in detail. In cases where the co-registration refinement result
  does not converge or where the quality number give indications of
  problems it is recommended not to deleted the intermediate files
  and check them carefully to be able to optimize the tresholds
  used. Deleting or not deleting the intermediate files is done by
  setting the cleaning flag to 1 (which is the default and which
  means the files are deleted) or to 0 to keep the intermediate
  files.</p>

  <p>The factor for the scaling of the double difference phase
  offset determined to an azimuth offset in SLC pixels is around
  -0.016 azimuth SLC pixel per radian. This sensitivity also means
  that there can be a phase ambiguity problem for higher azimuth
  co-registration errors. A double difference interferometric phase
  of a full phase cycle (2PI) is reached for an azimuth
  co-registration error close to 0.1 azimuth SLC pixel.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br></p>

  <p>Using <em>S1_coreg_overlap</em> to refine the co-registration
  for a slave acquired with a long temporal separation from the
  master scene may result in generally reduced coherence. As a way
  to optimize the coherence it is possible to indicate in addition
  to the master burst SLC a second already co-registered SLC
  (possibly one close in time to the slave considered). The program
  uses then this second scene to calculate the double-difference
  interfergrams, while the master geometry is the one of the true
  master.</p>

  <p>In cases where <em>S1_coreg_overlap</em> it may be necessary
  to start from already better co-registered burst SLCs. An initial
  quality of around 0.01 azimuth pixel should be achieved before
  running <em>S1_coreg_overlap</em>. Ways to achive this accuracy
  are matching techniques or to consider the overlap between the
  sub-swaths, as supported in the program <a href=
