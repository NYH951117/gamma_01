  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION<br></strong> <em>az_proc</em> reads the
  MSP SAR sensor parameter file, MSP SAR processing parameter file,
  and the SAR range compressed data. It performs azimuth
  compression using the range/doppler algorithm. Range migration is
  performed using <em>sinc</em> interpolator optimized for minimum
  error. The azimuth reference function is calculated from the
  along-track velocity and slant range distance. Output is in the
  form of complex floating point numbers (8 bytes per pixel) or
  complex short integer (4 bytes per pixel). The data is optionally
  deskewed and phase corrected to zero-Doppler geometry depending
  if the azimuth_deskew parameter in the MSP processing parameter
  file is ON or OFF. Radiometric compensation and calibration is
  applied. Corrections are performed for the slant range, antenna
  pattern, and receiver gain.</p>

  <p>The SAR sensor parameter File contains information on the SAR
  sensor system parameters and RAW data format. It also contains
  the SAR look angle at center swath and the name of the file
  containing the antenna diagram. The antenna diagram contains the
  1-way antenna gain pattern. Antenna gain patterns for the current
  spaceborne sensors are found in the <a href=
  "../sensors/">MSP/sensors/</a> directory. If the specific antenna
  diagram is not available a constant antenna gain (file
  MSP/sensors/constant_antenna.gain) can be used. The antenna gain
  pattern file shall be copied to the working directory.</p>

  <p>The two main functions of the MSP processing parameter File
  are the specification and documentation of SAR processing
  parameters. Certain processing parameters were extracted from the
  CEOS leader file provided with the SAR RAW data. Others were
  directly estimated from the SAR RAW data. Parameters specifying
  the image section to process, are defined by the user.</p>

  <p>For the output SLC the MSP processing parameter file documents
  the processing done as well as the image geometry and
  radiometry.<br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">az_proc</span> has the added
  capability to track the azimuth Doppler centroid variations when
  a 2D Doppler polynomial is stored in the processing parameter
  file. This 2D Doppler polynomial is generated using the program
  <a href="doppler_2d.html">doppler_2d</a> and is most useful for
  multi-frame Radarsat or JERS-1 data sets.</p>

  <p>The ouput SLC is either in FCOMPLEX (pairs of float) or
  SCOMPLEX (pairs of short integer) format, as specified in the
  slc_format parameter on the command line (0:FCOMPLEX,
  1:SCOMPLEX). The advantage of the SCOMPLEX format is the smaller
  (half) size of the output file. Nevertheless, care has to be
  taken that the real and imaginary parts of the output values are
  in the short integers range. The values can be scaled with the
  calibration factor cal_fact. Assuming absolute radiometric
  calibration and a scale factor of 1.0e06 (i.e. 1'000'000) results
  in a maximum backscattering coefficient of +30.3 dB.</p>

  <p>Continuous patch processing of the range compressed data is
  implemented. The range compressed data are processed in patches
  with FFT sizes of&nbsp; N*1024 (2048, 4096, &nbsp;6144, 8192,
  10240, 12240, 16384 ...) lines/block. The size of the block is
  optimally 2 times the length of the azimuth reference function.
  For ERS/ENVISAT this is 4096 samples.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><br>
  After the processing of each patch the result is written out to
  the output SLC. The number of lines written out is the patch size
  reduced by the length of the azimuth reference function and some
  additional lines to account for the image skew. To optimize the
  efficiency of the processing large patches are recommended, but
  the entire data for one patch should be in the computer memory
  without using the much slower swap space. This way multiple
  frames of ERS data with over 150000 lines have been processed to
  full resolution.</p>

  <p><strong>Radiometric Calibration</strong><br>
  The az_proc supports the radiometric calibration of the processed
  data. The output data is calibrated for the:<br>
  - range spreading loss<br>
  - antenna gain pattern<br>
  - ground-range projection factor</p>

  <p>The radiometric calibration factors are stored in a text
  format file (sensor_cal_MSP.dat) that can be found in the
  <a href="../sensors/">MSP/sensors/</a> directory. It can be
  examined with a text editor.</p>

  <p>Calibration experiments were conducted to determine absolute
  calibration factors for the processing of ERS1, ERS2, and JERS.
  In the case of ERS1 and ERS2 SAR RAW data over the Flevoland
  calibration site was used to determine the calibration factor
  based on active transponders with known radar cross sections. The
  MSP ERS1 and ERS2 calibration factors were validated by
  comparison of the MSP processed data with ERS PAF processed SLC
  data which were calibrated following the methodology described by
  H. Laur et al., ERS-1 SAR Radiometric Calibration, ESA-ESRIN,
  Frascati, Italy. The offset between MSP and ESA PAF processing
  was below 0.5 dB for both ERS-1 and ERS-2. The often almost
  identical values observed in ERS1 / ERS2 Tandem pairs further
  confirms the very good ERS calibration accuracy.</p>

  <p>Similarly, JERS RAW data over the Japanese Calibration site
  was used to determine the calibration factor based on active
  transponders with known radar cross sections. The MSP JERS
  calibration factor was validated by comparison of MSP processed
  data with a NASDA processed PRI product over a tropical forest
  site. For the validation example the NASDA processed values are
  0.77 dB lower than the MSP ones.</p>

  <p>Values for ENVISAT ASAR are currently available for the main
  mode, i.e. IS2 VV-polarization. The calibration constant was
  determined by comparing the MSP processed data with SLC data from
  ESA and calibrated with the GAMMA software. Several ROIs were
  selected and intensity values were compared, showing a constant
  offset.</p>

  <p>Similarly the calibration constants for a number of ALOS
  PALSAR modes were determined by comparing the MSP processed data
  with SLC data from JAXA EORC (calibrated). Several ROIs were
  selected and intensity values were compared. Typically the
  difference showed a constant offset which was set to correspond
  to GAMMA's MSP calibration constant. For more details it is
  referred to the file sensor_cal_MSP.dat.</p>

  <p>The&nbsp; calibration factors &nbsp;in sensor_cal_MSP.dat are
  for float value SLC data. &nbsp;If the data are in SCOMPLEX
  format, this scale factor must be augmented by 60 dB greater than
  the value in sensor_cal_MSP.dat . Currently we are determining
  the absolution radiometric calibration constants for
  Radarsat-1.<br></p>

  <p>Supported SLC output types are sigma0 and gamma0. In the case
  of sigma0 the SLC image intensity (SQR(re) + SQR(im)) corresponds
  to the backscattering coefficient sigma0 (normalized to the
  horizontal ground surface). In the case of gamma0 the SLC image
  intensity (SQR(re) + SQR(im)) corresponds to the backscattering
  coefficient gamma0. gamma0 and sigma0 are related by gamma0 =
  sigma0/cos(inc_ang) with inc_ang the incidence angle of the
  horizontal surface.</p>

  <p>As default Kaiser window parameter beta for the azimuth
  reference function 2.120 is used. A lower value such as 1.0 leads
  to somewhat sharper point targets (such as calibration targets),
  nevertheless at the price of a higher stopband ripple. The
  radiometric calibration is not affected by the selected kaiser
  window parameter beta.</p>

  <p>The resulting complex images in FCOMPLEX format can be
  displayed using <a href="MSP_display.html">disSLC</a>. The
  resulting complex images in SCOMPLEX format can be displayed
  using the ISP program disERS_SLC. Notice that the zero byte line
  header size needs to be indicated when using disERS_SLC.
  Multi-looking of the complex output image in FCOMPLEX format can
  be done with <a href="multi_SLC.html">multi_SLC</a>.
  Multi-looking of the complex output image in SCOMPLEX format can
  be done with the ISP program multi_look_ESA after creation of the
  ISP SLC parameter file using the ISP program par_MSP.</p>
