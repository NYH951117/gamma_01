  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br>

  <p>Unwraps the differential interferogram 19990915_19991020.diff,
  using the coherence file 19990915_19991020.cc as weights for the
  MCF solution. No mask file is provided, consequently all non-NULL
  values are unwrapped. The interferogram width is 1024 samples.
  Output is written to 01608_02109.unw. A filled triangular mesh is
  used for the unwrapping.</p>

  <p>Similar to above, but now only a 768x768 section of the input
  interferogram is unwrapped. A validity mask
  (19990915_19991020.cc.mask.ras) is used to indicate areas which
  should and areas which should not be unwrapped (for example
  because of too high phase noise). A Delaunay triangulation is
  used in this case instead of the default filled triangular mesh,
  because the data has gaps. The unwrapping is done in 4 patches (2
  in range and 2 in azimuth) with an overlap of 256 samples between
  patches.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>

  <p><em>mcf</em> is a standalone phase unwrapping program for
  complex input data.</p>

  <p>Triangulation is used to generate a network describing the
  data values. This has two main advantages, namely, that the
  network is two times denser than the rectangular network and that
  spatially incomplete data can easily be dealt with. Gaps in the
  data can be specified using a validity mask file. This Sun raster
  or BMP format file has values of (0,0,0) in regions that will not
  be unwrapped. Only points with non-zero values will be
  triangulated and unwrapped. Delaunay triangulation is used to
  generate an optimized irregular triangular network.</p>

  <p>The minimum cost flow (MCF) algorithm is used to minimize the
  total cost associated with phase discontinuities in the scene
  associated with noise, and layover. The user supplies weights
  (usually related to the coherence) used to calculate where
  discontinuities (i.e. network flow) are preferred. Regions of low
  weight have low costs for phase jumps whereas areas of high cost
  tend to exclude such discontinuities in the unwrapped phase.</p>

  <p>Each triangle is a node in the network. If integration of the
  phase around a triangle indicates a a positive phase
  discontinuity (residue) then the node is marked as contributing
  flow to the network. A negative phase discontinuity at a node is
  marked as accepting flow from the network. The cost of flow in an
  arc connecting adjacent nodes is derived from the weight file
  provided. Typically, the interferometric correlation is used as
  weight file. The MCF algorithm solves for the flow in the arcs
  that minimizes the net cost. The implemented MCF solution is
  based on the successive shortest path (SSP) method.</p>

  <p>Correlation values are usually used for the weighting
  function. Be sure to specify the starting sample position and the
  number of range and azimuth samples to unwrap such that weights
  values are available. Because of the window function used to
  estimate the correlation, there will be a few pixels at the edge
  of the correlation that will be set to 0. Using the mask file can
  take care of this detail in the operation of the unwrapping. The
  program <a href="rascc_mask.html">rascc_mask</a> can be used to
  generate a mask file, with pixel values set to 0 for regions of
  the image that have correlation values below a user specified
  threshold.</p>

  <p>The triangulation network structure can also be used to reduce
  the amount of data to be unwrapped. Areas of high phase noise can
  be masked out by accordingly defining a validity mask. This
  process can also be supported by adaptive reduction of the
  sampling. In areas of low phase variation larger sample spacings
  are acceptable. This may be used to reduce the network size to
  allow global optimization, even for large data sets. The program
  <a href="rascc_mask_thinning.html">rascc_mask_thinning</a>
  supports this.</p>

  <p>To unwrap images larger than can be processed with the
  available computer RAM, the input is divided into patches in
  range and azimuth. For the default patch size (1024x1024), the
  memory requirements is approximately 320 MB. The results from
  unwrapping the individual patches is combined by comparing the
  phase values within the overlapping regions of the patches.</p>

  <p>The user can independently specify the number of patches in
  range and azimuth, and the size of the the overlap on the command
  line. Generally it is advised to select patches as large as
  possible that do not exceed the RAM resources of the machine.
  Furthermore, it is recommended to reduce the number of azimuth
  patches. If a phase unwrapping error is evident on the patch
  boundary, changing the number patches or the patch overlap may
  eliminate the error. The overlap between patches is an important
  parameter. Large overlaps such as half the patch size permit to
  minimize errors. Attempt if possible, to select the patch
  boundaries to lie in areas of high fringe visibility and minimal
  terrain.</p>
