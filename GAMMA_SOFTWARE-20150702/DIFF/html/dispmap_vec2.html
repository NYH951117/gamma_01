  <p>Calculates the 3D displacement field based on the 2 indicated
  DINSAR based line-of-sight displacement component (from ascending
  and descending orbits) and the assumption that the displacement
  is towards a vertical axis located at the coordinate (186050
  2465870). The output displacement field is expressed through the
  easting (x), northing (y) and vertical (z) components.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  dispmap_vec2 calculates the displacement vector field based on
  two indicated DINSAR based components and an additional
  assumption on the displacement direction field.</p>

  <p>The two indicated DINSAR based components correspond typically
  to an ascending and a descending orbit based result, so that the
  directions of the two observed compontents differ significantly.
  The use of two indipendent observations (two interferograms)
  acquired in the same satellite track is not adequate.</p>

  <p>Based on the two motion components observed with
  interferometry the 3D motion vector field cannot be determined,
  an additional constraint is required. Two such additional
  constraints are supported by the program. The first one is thast
  the motion shall be in the terrain surface plain. This constraint
  seems adequate in the case of glacier motion. The second
  constraint is that the motion vector points towards a central
  axis. This is an adequate assumption for concentric deformation
  pattern as may occur under certain circumstances in the case of
  subsidence and for volcanic deformation.</p>

  <p>The dimensions of the image files and the map projection which
  is the reference are defined in the DEM/map parameter file. The
  DEM is required for the caluclation of the terrain surface
  plain.</p>

  <p>Differential interferometry permits to estimate the
  deformation component in the SAR look direction. This DINSAR
  based information is specified through the displacement component
  in the look direction and the direction angles (elevation theta
  and orientation phi) in the map geometry. The look vector
  direction angles can be determined using the program <a href=
  "look_vector.html">look_vector</a>. DINSAR based information
  needs to be provided for two observations in different
  directions, typically corresponding to ascending and descending
  track acquisitions.</p>

  <p>Apart from the two components (and related directions)
  provided the additional condition constraints one more dimension,
  permitting to calculate the 3D motioin field.</p>

  <p>The output displacement vector is available as displacement
  norm, elevation and orientation angles, or as easting (x),
  northing (y) and vertical (up) components, stored in separate
  binary files (float).</p>

  <p>The elevation angle is defined as the angle between the
  horizontal surface and the look vector with positive angles
  indicating sensor positions above the surface. The orientation
  angle is defined as the angle between the East direction and the
  projection of the look vector on the horizontal surface plan. The
  orientation angle increases towards north, with the North
  direction corresponding to PI/2 (and south to -PI/2). Both angles
  are expresed in radian.</p>

  <p>Warning: the interferometric observation is only sensitive to
  motion in the SAR look vector directions. For other directions
  the sensitivity is reduced which will lead to higher errors. The
  ascending and descending components may be far from perpendicular
  to each other. In the case of ERS, for example, both observation
  directions will be at quite steep angles (about 23 deg. from the
  normal). As a result horizontal motion in East-West direction is
  measured at much more accurate than North-South motion.</p>
