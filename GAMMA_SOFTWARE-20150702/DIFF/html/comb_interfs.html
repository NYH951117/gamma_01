  <p>Creates a complex valued "combined interferogram based on the
  two input interferograms by scaling the wrapped phases by factors
  of 1 and -3 for the first and second input interferogram,
  respectively.</p>

  <p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong><br>
  Source code comb_interfs.c in ./src. For compilation adjust and
  use Makefile: Executable version comb_interfs in ../bin</p>

  <p><strong>AVAILABILITY</strong><br>
  Uses ISP and DIFF type definition files <a href=
  "typedef_ISP.h.html">typedef_ISP.h</a>, <a href=
  "typedef_DIFF.h.html">typedef_DIFF.h</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <em>comb_interfs</em> combines two registered complex valued
  interferograms into a new complex valued interferogram. The phase
  of the new combined interferogram is equal to:<br>
  (wrapped_ phase_1 * factor_1 + wrapped_phase_2 * factor_2) modulo
  2&pi;<br>
  . The coherence of the combined interferogram is estimated based
  on the assumption that the signal noise is scaled up with the
  scaling factors, summed, and divided by the square root of 2 to
  account for statistical independence of the two interferograms.
  The signal is assumed to be the original signal multiplied by the
  user specified signal multiplication factor sm. As default value
  sm=1.0 is used standing for unchanged signal as compared to one
  of the original interferograms.</p>

  <p>As shown by the following considerations only integer valued
  phase scaling factors seem to be reasonable. The "wrapped"
  interferometric phase, i.e. the phase information available from
  an interferogram without phase unwrapping, is defined as the
  "unwrapped" interferometric phase modulo 2&pi;</p>

  <p><img src="eq_01.gif" alt="equation 01" align="middle" border=
  "1"></p>

  <p>When scaling the interferometric phase, which is of interest
  for example to simulate the interferogram obtained with another
  baseline, we have to be aware of the fact that in principle the
  "unwrapped" interferometric phase needs to be scaled. When
  scaling with a positive or negative integer number the scaling of
  the "wrapped" phase may be directly scaled as the unknown number
  i of 2&pi; remains an integer even after the scaling, i.e.</p>

  <p><img src="eq_02.gif" alt="equation 01" align="middle" border=
  "1"></p>

  <p>The combination of complex interferograms after scaling of the
  "wrapped" interferometric phase with integer numbers may be of
  interest for several reasons:<br>
  - To do a kind of differential interferometry without phase
  unwrapping and geocoding requirement.<br>
  - To improve the sensitivity to topography.</p>

  <p>In the first case the sensitivity to the topography is reduced
  as much as possible, in order to have a phase of the combined
  complex interferogram which is mainly determined by differential
  effects. The reduction of the sensitivity to topography is
  achieved by reducing the "simulated" baseline of the combined
  interferogram to a small value. A perpendicular baseline
  component of the combined interferogram of only 10m, for example,
  can be achieved by combination of two interferograms with
  perpendicular baseline components of 50m and 160m through scaling
  of the wrapped phases with factors of 3 and -1, respectively. In
  this example the unwrapped phase of the combined interferogram
  corresponds to the topographic phase of an interferogram with a
  10 m baseline (i.e. a very small sensitivity to topography), plus
  3 times the differential phase effects present in the first
  interferogram minus 1 time the differential phase of effects
  present in the second interferogram.</p>

  <p>In the second case the phase noise and the sensitivity to
  differential effects is reduced and the sensitivity to topography
  is increased. The reduction of the sensitivity to differential
  effects is achieved simply by addition of independent
  interferograms. Assuming that the unwanted differential effects
  (I am thinking mainly of atmospheric distortions) of the two
  interferograms are independent allows to decrease their
  influence. At the same time the baseline of the combined
  interferogram may be increased as compared to the initial
  interferograms. Because the phase noise of the individual
  interferograms is multiplied with the scaling factors small
  scaling factors are preferred. The combination of two independent
  interferograms with comparable perpendicular baseline components
  (using scaling factors of 1), for example, allows increases the
  simulated baseline of the combined interferogram to twice that of
  the individual interferograms with a phase noise of the combined
  interferogram of only about 1.4 times that of the individual
  interferograms.</p>

  <p>About the same technique but for another purpose was presented
  by Massonnet D., H. Vadon, and M. Rossi, Reduction of the need
  for phase unwrapping in radar interferometry, IEEE TGRS, 34-2
  pp.489-497, 1996. Their idea was to generate combined
  interferograms with relatively small baselines in order to reduce
  the need of phase unwrapping.</p>

  <p>As an example of an interferogram with a "combined"
  perpendicular baseline component of 21m obtained by combining
  registered complex interferograms of 58m and 95m perpendicular
  baseline components using phase scale factors of 2 and -1,
  respectively, for Solothurn, Switzerland.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  Selection of phase scaling factors of 1 and -1 allows to generate
  a complex valued interferogram with the phase corresponding to
  the difference between the phase of the first and second complex
  valued interferograms.</p>
