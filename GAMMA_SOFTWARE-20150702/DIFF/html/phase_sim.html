  <p>Simulates an unwrapped phase image for the specific geometry
  of an interferometric pair using a height map in the geometry of
  the interferogram. The simulated interferogram is unflattened and
  uses the precision baseline.</p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">phase_sim</span> simulates an
  interferogram based on a height map in SAR geometry, linear
  baseline model, and possibly a deformation rate map, both in SAR
  range-Doppler coordinates (RDC). To calculate the deformation
  phase the user must also provide the number days between images
  used to calculate the specific interferogram pair. The imaging
  geometry of a specific interferometric pair is used for the phase
  calculation. This geometry is defined by the SLC parameter file
  of the reference SLC image (containing information on the SAR
  sensor, the processing applied, and the orbit geometry) the
  baseline file (containing the information on the interferometric
  baseline to be used for the simulation), and the ISP
  processing/offset parameter file (containing information on the
  selected SLC image section and the multi-looking applied in
  interferometric processing). In the case of interferograms all
  generated using the same reference image, use the parameter file
  of the reference image as the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">SLC1_par</span> argument.</p>

  <p>The height map in SAR geometry is obtained by resampling a
  digital elevation model (DEM) to SAR coordinates. The geometric
  transformation is determined by simulation of a SAR intensity
  image (in SAR geometry) from the DEM. The simulated SAR intensity
  image is then registered to a real SAR intensity image using a
  cross correlation registration approach for real valued data.
  This step is required to remove errors resulting from small
  errors in the orbit geometry. If a - is entered for the height
  file, then all heights are set to 0.0. The number of range and
  azimuth looks of the height map should be the same for the output
  interferogram.</p>

  <p>Simulated phase images are mainly used for 2-pass differential
  interferometry. In 2-pass differential interferometry the phase
  corresponding to the terrain topography is simulated and
  subtracted from an interferometric pair which contains both
  differential and topographic phase components. Another potential
  application of a simulated phase image isto help generate a
  higher quality DEM with interferometry. The simulated phase is
  subtracted from the interferogram and the residual phase is
  unwrapped and processed to generate a higher resolution product.
  Using the differential interferogram facilitates filtering and
  phase unwrapping to achieve higher accuracy in the final DEM
  product.</p>

  <p>Notice, that the baseline geometry described in the baseline
  file is may not be perfect and have residual quadratic phase
  trends. One approach to remove these trends is to use <a href=
  "quad_fit.html">quad_fit</a> and <a href=
  "quad_sub.html">quad_sub</a>.</p>

  <p>The process for calculation of a deformation rate map using
  <i>phase_sim</i> can be as follows. First obtain an initial
  simulated interferogram using a DEM, without the deformation
  model in the call to <i>phase_sim</i>. Next subtract this
  simulated interferogram from the original interferogram using
  <a href="sub_phase.html">sub_phase</a> or generate the
  differential interferogram directly from the resampled SLC data
  using <a href="SLC_diff_intf.html">SLC_diff_intf</a>.</p>

  <p>Note that the the residual phase is the combination of
  residual baseline error, deformation, and tropospheric phase.
  Therefore it is important to select a time interval for the
  interferogram that is sufficiently long that the deformation
  phase dominates over baseline error and tropospheric phase.</p>

  <p>The interferometric mode (<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">int_mode)</span> option permits selection
  of either single or repeat pass mode. The single pass
  interferometric phase is half as large as the repeat pass
  simulated phase because the path difference is half that compared
  to repeat pass interferometry.&nbsp; Tandem-X data are acquired
  in single-pass mode where one satellite transmits and the other
  receives. In this case <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">int_mode</span> must be set to 0 to
  correctly simulate the interferometric phase.<br></p>

  <p><i>phase_sim</i> can be used for cross-platform interferometry
  between ERS and ASAR where the sensors have different carrier
  frequencies. To do this this the SLC parameter file of SLC2R must
  be provided on the command line.</p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  Setting the phase flattening flag (<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">ph_flag</span>) to 0 results in an
  unwrapped phase in the geometry of the original interferogram
  (without flat Earth phase trend removed).&nbsp; Setting the
  flattening flag to 1 simulates an unwrapped phase image with the
  ellipsoidal Earth phase trend removed.</p>

  <p>There is also the <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">ph_mode</span> command line option to
  subtract a multiple of 2PI from the simulated interferogram to
  improve the accuracy of the single-precision phase data stored in
  the output file. When there is a large difference in slant range,
  the magnitude of the interferometric phase can become large
  enough (~200000) such that there is a a measurable loss of
  accuracy in the phase data due to the single-precision
  representation.&nbsp; The value of the phase that is subtracted
  from the entire simulated interferogram is calculated from the
  simulated phase at the center of the interferogram with a height
  of 0.0. This phase value is then rounded to the nearest multiple
  of 2PI. All internal calculations related to the phase that are
  internal to the program are performed using double-precision.</p>
