  <p><strong>EXAMPLE<br></strong></p>

  <p><samp>autof ERS1_ESA.par p8560.slc.par 8560.rc
  8560.autof</samp></p>

  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><em>autof</em> reads SAR sensor
  parameter, SAR processing parameter and SAR range compressed data
  and calculates an estimate of the along-track velocity of the
  radar platform using cross correlation of images derived from
  different segments of the azimuth Doppler spectrum. A shift in
  azimuth between these looks is proportional to a velocity error
  for the platform and is corrected by the program.</p>

  <p>Each of the sub-aperture images is formed from 1/4 of the
  Doppler spectrum, space 1/2 PRF apart. Two looks are taken in
  azimuth so that the image is still oversampled by 2:1. The
  detected images are cross correlated to measure the range and
  azimuth offsets. A 1-D cut of the 2-D correlation function (at
  range offset 0.0) is written to a text file specified on the
  command line. Plotting of this function can be performed using
  gnuplot.<br></p>

  <p>echo "plot '8560.autof' u 1:2 lc 3 lw .5" | gnuplot</p>

  <p>The shift of the peak from 0 in azimuth is proportional to the
  focus error. There are two columns in the file, the first is the
  azimuth sample number and the second column is the correlation
  function. Perfect focus is indicated when the peak of the
  correlation function is at 0 azimuth offset. The text file
  containing the correlation function has the following format:</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>column 1</td>

        <td>azimuth correlation offset (in pixels)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>column 2</td>

        <td>autofocus correlation function</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table><br>

  <p>Low correlation values can occur if the scene is devoid of
  contrast, such as over the open ocean or on an ice sheet. A
  threshold for the SNR of the correlation peak can be specified on
  the command line as the parameter <u>SNR_min</u>. <em>autof</em>
  may be run several times to iteratively improve the estimate of
  the along-track velocity.</p>

  <p>The number of azimuth image samples used by <i>autof</i> to
  determine the offset can be specified by the command line
  parameter <u>auto_az.</u> The number of range bins is given by
  the parameter <u>auto_bins</u>. Large values for <u>auto_bins</u>
  will reduce the correlation SNR because the azimuth offset due to
  a focus error is not constant value as a function of slant range.
  Conversely, using a wide swath (e.g. auto_bins = 4096) will lead
  to a more robust estimation procedure when operationally
  processing a large numbers of scenes with variable image
  contrast.</p>

  <p>A range offset between the looks is caused by uncompensated
  range migration, with the most likely cause being an error in the
  Doppler centroid by 1 or more multiples of the PRF. This is one
  of the best methods for Doppler ambiguity resolution and is
  implemented by <i>autof</i>. If the range displacement is greater
  than half the range migration over the synthetic aperture then
  processing with the wrong Doppler ambiguity is the most likely
  cause. The program then updates the Doppler centroid by the
  correct number of ambiguities The user can control the use of
  this method through the <u>dop_ambig_corr</u> flag.&nbsp; The
  autofocus offset function can be plotted versus azimuth sample
  number using gnuplot.<br></p>

  <p><code>echo "plot 'slc/19960615.autof' u 1:2 with lines lc 3 lw
  .5 "|gnuplot</code><br>
  <br>
  <code><br></code></p>

  <p><strong>OPTIONS</strong><br>
  If the velocity does not converge, then a possible cause is that
  the image is featureless, such as open water or an ice, or that
  there is an error in the processing parameters. Possible culprits
  are the Doppler centroid, range to the first sample, or initial
  value for the along-track velocity caused by incorrect state
  vectors. Radio interference (RFI) visible in JERS data can also
  corrupt the autofocus by obliterating the scene. Examination of
  the image patches (autof1.mli, autof2.mli, see options) can be
  helpful to diagnose the cause of autofocus failure. The solution
  is to look at another region of the image where there is
  sufficient contrast to give meaningful answers.</p>

  <p>The single-look image patches generated by <i>autof</i> may be
  stored in the files autof1.mli and autof2.mli. The 2-D
  correlation function is also written out as the file auto.cc.
  These intensity images have a width equal to (auto_az/2) and can
  be viewed using a display programs such as <i>dis2pwr</i>. In
  order for <i>autof</i> to write out these images it must be
  compiled with the -DAUTO_IMAGES option.</p>
